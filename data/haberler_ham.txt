Threat actors have been observed exploiting a recently disclosed critical security flaw impacting BeyondTrust Remote Support (RS) and Privileged Remote Access (PRA) products to conduct a wide range of malicious actions, including deploying VShell and

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-1731 (CVSS score: 9.9), allows attackers to execute operating system commands in the context of the site user.

In a report published Thursday, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 said it detected the security flaw being actively exploited in the wild for network reconnaissance, web shell deployment, command-and-control (C2), backdoor and remote management tool installs, lateral movement, and data theft.

The campaign has targeted financial services, legal services, high technology, higher education, wholesale and retail, and healthcare sectors across the U.S., France, Germany, Australia, and Canada.

The cybersecurity company described the vulnerability as a case of sanitization failure that enables an attacker to leverage the affected "thin-scc-wrapper" script that's reachable via WebSocket interface to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands in the context of the site user.

"While this account is distinct from the root user, compromising it effectively grants the attacker control over the appliance's configuration, managed sessions and network traffic," security researcher Justin Moore said.

The current scope of attacks exploiting the flaw range from reconnaissance to backdoor deployment -

Using a custom Python script to gain access to an administrative account.

Installing multiple web shells across directories, including a PHP backdoor that's capable of executing raw PHP code or running arbitrary PHP code without writing new files to disk, as well as a bash dropper that establishes a persistent web shell.

Deploying malware such as VShell and Spark RAT.

Using out-of-band application security testing (OAST) techniques to validate successful code execution and fingerprint compromised systems.

Executing commands to stage, compress and exfiltrate sensitive data, including configuration files, internal system databases and a full PostgreSQL dump, to an external server.

"The relationship between CVE-2026-1731 and CVE-2024-12356 highlights a localized, recurring challenge with input validation within distinct execution pathways," Unit 42 said.

"CVE-2024-12356's insufficient validation was using third-party software (postgres), while CVE-2026-1731's insufficient validation problem occurred in the BeyondTrust Remote Support (RS) and older versions of the BeyondTrust Privileged Remote Access (PRA) codebase."

With CVE-2024-12356 exploited by China-nexus threat actors like Silk Typhoon, the cybersecurity company noted that CVE-2026-1731 could also be a target for sophisticated threat actors.

The development comes as the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) updated its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog entry for CVE-2026-1731 to confirm that the bug has been exploited in ransomware campaigns.

In an update to its advisory, BeyondTrust stated that exploitation attempts targeting the flaw were first detected on January 31, 2026, after "anomalous activity" was flagged on a single Remote Support appliance, at least a week before it was publicly disclosed on February 6, 2026.

"BeyondTrust is aware of and supporting a limited number of self-hosted customers in responding to active exploitation attempts of the previously disclosed critical vulnerability (CVE-2026-1731) in its Remote Support and Privileged Remote Access solutions," the company said.

"Observed exploitation activity has been limited to internet-facing, self-hosted environments where the patch had not been applied before February 9, 2026."

[TAM METİN - 400 kelime]
Advantest Corporation disclosed that its corporate network has been targeted in a ransomware attack that may have affected customer or employee data.

Preliminary investigation results revealed that an intruder gained access to certain parts of the company’s network on February 15.

Tokyo-based Advantest is a global leader in testing equipment for semiconductors, measuring instruments, digital consumer products, and wireless communications equipment.

The company employs 7,600 people, has an annual revenue of more than $5 billion, and a market capitalization of $120 billion.

On February 15, the firm detected unusual activity in its IT environment, prompting a response in accordance with incident response protocols, including the isolation of affected systems.

As part of its response, the company contracted third-party cybersecurity specialists to help isolate the threat and investigate its impact.

“Preliminary findings appear to indicate that an unauthorized third party may have gained access to portions of the company’s network and deployed ransomware,” Advantest states.

“If our investigation determines that customer or employee data was affected, we will notify impacted persons directly and provide guidance on protective measures.”

Currently, no data theft has been confirmed, but Advantest noted that this may change as more information emerges from the ongoing investigation.

Should customers or staff be determined to be impacted, Advantest will notify them directly and provide instructions on mitigating the associated risks.

At the time of writing, no ransomware groups have claimed the attack on the Japanese tech giant.

BleepingComputer has contacted Advantest directly to request more details about the attack, but we have not heard back by publishing time.

Multiple Japanese companies have been the target of cyberattacks recently, as several high-profile entities suffered data breaches and operational disruptions. Notable examples include Washington Hotel, Nissan, Muji, Asahi, and NTT.

Advantest says that the investigation continues and that it will provide updates on the incident when new details emerge.

Hackers are actively exploiting the CVE-2026-1731 vulnerability in the BeyondTrust Remote Support product, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warns.

The security issue affects BeyondTrust's Remote Support 25.3.1 or earlier and Privileged Remote Access 24.3.4 or earlier, and can be exploited for remote code execution.

CISA added it to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog on February 13 and gave federal agencies just three days to apply the patch or stop using the product.

BeyondTrust initially disclosed CVE-2026-1731 on February 6. The security advisory classified it as a pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability caused by an OS command injection weakness, exploitable via specially crafted client requests sent to vulnerable endpoints.

Proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits for CVE-2026-1731 became available shortly after, and in-the-wild exploitation started almost immediately.

On February 13, BeyondTrust updated the bulletin  to say that exploitation had been detected on January 31, making CVE-2026-1731 a zero-day vulnerability for at least a week.

BeyondTrust states that the report from researcher Harsh Jaiswal and the Hacktron AI team confirmed the anomalous activity that they detected on a single Remote Support appliance at the time.

CISA has now activated the ‘Known To Be Used in Ransomware Campaigns?’ indicator in the KEV catalog.

For customers of the cloud-based application (SaaS), the vendor states the patch was applied automatically on February 2, so no manual intervention is needed.

Customers of the self-hosted instances need to either enable automatic updates and verify that the patch was applied via the '/appliance' interface or manually install it.

For Remote Support, the recommendation is to install version 25.3.2. Privileged Remote Access users should switch to version 25.1.1 or newer.

Those still at RS v21.3 and PRA v22.1 are recommended to upgrade to a newer version before applying the patch.

[TAM METİN - 463 kelime]
The French Ministry of Finance has disclosed a cybersecurity incident that impacted data associated with 1.2 million user accounts.

The investigation discovered that hackers gained access to the national bank account registry (FICOBA) and stole a database containing sensitive information.

The Ministry's announcement notes that in late January, a threat actor used credentials stolen from a civil servant with access to the interministerial information sharing platform.

The credentials gave the hacker access to part of a database that contained all bank accounts opened in French banking institutions and personal data:

Bank account details, including RIBs/IBANs

Account holder identity

Taxpayer identification number (only in some cases)

The Ministry states that it took immediate action to restrict the threat actor’s access to its systems immediately after detecting the incident. However, it is believed that data of about 1.2 million accounts were already exposed to potential exfiltration.

FICOBA is a centralized state-managed registry of bank accounts in France, operated by the French tax authority, the Direction générale des Finances publiques (DGFiP).

It operates as a database that records the existence and identifiers of accounts, with data provided by French banking institutions in accordance with tax enforcement law requirements.

The cyberattack has disrupted the system's operations, and work is underway to restore it with enhanced security. However, there is no estimation of when FICOBA will be back online.

The Ministry also stated that users affected by the incident will be notified individually over the next few days.

Banking institutions in the country have been informed accordingly, and they are expected to take action to raise awareness among their customers of the need for increased vigilance.

The announcement mentions numerous scam attempts circulating via email and SMS that aim to steal data or money directly from recipients, and citizens are advised not to respond to them.

“The tax administration never asks for your login credentials or bank card number via message,” the French ministry warns.

The French data protection authority, CNIL, has also been informed about the incident.

DGFiP’s IT team is currently working with the Ministry of Finance and the National Cybersecurity Agency of France (ANSSI) to strengthen system security and bring it back to full operational status.

PayPal has disclosed a data breach caused by a software bug in its PayPal Working Capital loan app. The flaw exposed sensitive customer information, including customers’ business contact details (name, email, phone number, address), along with Social Security numbers and dates of birth, since July 1, 2025, before it was discovered and fixed.

On December 12, 2025, PayPal discovered that a coding error in its PayPal Working Capital loan application had exposed the personal information of a small number of customers to unauthorized parties between July 1 and December 13, 2025. The company has since addressed the issue and said the notification was not delayed due to any law enforcement investigation.

“On December 12, 2025, PayPal identified that due to an error in its PayPal Working Capital (“PPWC”) loanapplication, the PII of a small number of customers was exposed to unauthorized individuals during thetimeframe of July 1, 2025 to December 13, 2025. PayPal has since rolled back the code change responsiblefor this error, which potentially exposed the PII.” reads the data breach notification. “We have not delayed this notification as a result of any law enforcement investigation”

After detecting the unauthorized access, the company launched an investigation, blocked the intrusion, and reset affected passwords. PayPal also announced the implementation of stronger security checks. The company confirmed that a small number of customers observed unauthorized transactions, which have already been refunded.

The company also offers impacted users two years of complimentary credit monitoring and identity restoration services through Equifax.

Affected users should closely monitor their accounts, transaction history, and free credit reports for suspicious activity and report any fraud immediately. Customers are also encouraged to enroll in complimentary three-bureau credit monitoring through Equifax by June 30, 2026. The company advises reviewing guidance on fraud alerts, free credit reports, and FTC resources to better protect personal information.

In January 2023, PayPal announced that 34942 customers’ accounts had been compromised between December 6 and December 8, 2022. The company added that the unauthorized access was the result of credential stuffing attacks and that its systems were not breached.

[6] Graham Cluley - Spanish police say they have arrested hacker who booked luxury hotel rooms for just one cent

[TAM METİN - 470 kelime]
Looking back over the years, I've spent an inordinate amount of time when planning a trip trying to find the best online price for my hotel stay. Does it make more sense to book directly with the hotel itself or a comparison site? Are there other websites that will offer a better deal that could shave a few dollars off the total package?

Frankly, for the actual amount of money I have saved, I'm not sure that it was necessarily always time well spent.

But if I was able to book hotel rooms worth up to €1,000 just for a single euro cent? Well, that would be beyond my wildest dreams.

And yet, according to Spanish police, one young man managed to make that dream a reality... until he got caught.

Spain's police force has announced that it has arrested a 20-year-old man who they claim managed to book luxury hotel rooms worth up to €1,000 a night for just one euro cent."

At the time of his arrest on 18 February, the man was mid-stay at an unnamed luxury Madrid hotel, having booked four nights that should have cost €4,000 - allegedly paying just one cent for the privilege.

The man - whose identity has not been released - allegedly targeted the payment gateway of a well-known online travel and hotel booking website.

It is claimed that when it came time to pay, the man selected a standard payment platform, but performed a high-tech sleight of hand during the communication between the booking site and the bank.

According to reports, which are being understandably kept high-level to avoid copycats, the attack did not meddle with the price displayed on the hotel booking site, but instead interfered with the message sent back to the booking site so that it claimed the transaction had been authorised.

In this way, the suspect was able to trick the system into registering a hotel booking as having been fully paid for the correct amount, while the actual amount processed was just one cent.

Apparently the discrepancy in the true amount that had been paid only became apparent days later, when the payment platform transferred the actual amount received to the hotel's bank account.

By which point, of course, the guest could already be checked into the hotel - or might have even already checked out without properly settling the bill.

The travel booking agency firm reported the suspected fraud to the police on 2 February, noting that multiple fraudulent reservations had been made via its website. Computer crime investigators described their probe into the incident as "highly complex" and "technical."

According to police, the suspect had used the technique on multiple occasions, often helping himself to minibar items, and leaving bills unpaid. One hotel is said to have suffered losses of more than €20,000.

Japanese-Language Phishing Emails

For at least the past year or so, I've been receiving Japanese-language phishing emails to my blog email addresses at @malware-traffic-analysis.net.  I'm not Japanese, but I suppose my blog's email addresses ended up on a list used by the group sending these emails. They're all easily caught by my spam filters, so they're not especially dangerous in my situation. However, they could be effective for the Japanese-speaking recipients with poor spam filtering.

Despite the different companies impersonated, they all follow a similar pattern for the phishing page URLs and email-sending addresses.

This diary reviews three examples of these phishing emails.

Shown above: The spam folder for my blog's admin email account.

The first screenshot shows an example of a phishing email impersonating the Japanese airline ANA (All Nippon Airways). Both the sending email address and the link for the phishing page use domains with a .cn top-level domain (TLD).

Shown above: Example of a Japanese phishing email impersonating ANA.

The second screenshot shows an example of a phishing email impersonating the shipping/logistics company DHL. Like the previous example, both the sending email address and the link for the phishing page use domains with a .cn top-level domain (TLD).

Shown above: Example of a Japanese phishing email impersonating DHL.

Finally, the third screenshot shows an example of a phishing email impersonating the utilities company myTOKYOGAS. Like the previous two examples, both the sending email address and the link for the phishing page use domains with a .cn top-level domain (TLD).

Shown above: Example of a Japanese phishing email impersonating myTOKYOGAS.

As noted earlier, these emails have different themes, but they have similar patterns that indicate these were sent from the same group.

Indicators of the Activity

Received: from ncqjw[.]cn (unknown [150.5.129[.]136])

Date: Thu, 19 Feb 2026 21:52:36 +0800

From: "ANA" <member.llbyzmf@ncqjw[.]cn>

X-mailer: Foxmail 6, 13, 102, 15 [cn]

Received: from obpwnrl[.]cn (unknown [101.47.78[.]193])

Date: Fri, 20 Feb 2026 12:29:35 +0800

From: "DHL" <dmail.elthr@obpwnrl[.]cn>

X-mailer: Foxmail 6, 13, 102, 15 [cn]

Date: Fri, 20 Feb 2026 23:50:56 +0800

From: "myTOKYOGAS" <reportogkfgkbye@cwqfvzp[.]cn>

X-mailer: Foxmail 6, 13, 102, 15 [cn]

Link for phishing page: hxxps[:]//impactish.rexqm[.]cn/mtgalogin/

The most telling indicator that these emails were sent from the same group is the X-mailer: Foxmail 6, 13, 102, 15 [cn] line in the email headers.

I'm not likely to be tricked into giving up information for accounts that I don't have, like for myTOKYOGAS or for DHL.  Other recipients could be tricked by these, though, assuming they make it past a recipient's spam filter.

I'm curious how effective these phishing emails are, because the group behind this activity appears to be casting a wide net that reaches non-Japanese speakers.

If anyone else has received these types of phishing emails, feel free to leave a comment or submit an example via our contact page.

[8] Cyberscoop - Anthropic rolls out embedded security scanning for Claude 
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 698 kelime]
Anthropic is rolling out a new security feature for Claude Code that can scan a user’s software codebases for vulnerabilities and suggest patching solutions.

The company announced Friday that Claude Code Security will initially be available to a limited number of enterprise and team customers for testing. That follows more than a year of stress-testing by the internal red teamers, competing in cybersecurity Capture the Flag contests and working with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to refine the accuracy of the tool’s scanning features.

Large language models have shown increasing promise at both code generation and cybersecurity tasks over the past two years, speeding up the software development process but also lowering the technical bar required to create new websites, apps and other digital tools.

“We expect that a significant share of the world’s code will be scanned by AI in the near future, given how effective models have become at finding long-hidden bugs and security issues,” the company wrote in a blog post.

Those same capabilities also let bad actors scan a victim’s IT environment faster to find weaknesses they can exploit. Anthropic is betting that as  “vibe coding” becomes more widespread, the demand for automated vulnerability scanning will pass the need for manual security reviews.

As more people use AI to generate their software and applications, an embedded vulnerability scanner could potentially reduce the number of vulnerabilities that come with it. The goal is to reduce large chunks of the software security review process to a few clicks, with the user approving any patching or changes prior to deployment.

Anthropic claims that Claude Code Security “reads and reasons about your code the way a human researcher would,” showing an understanding of how different software components interact, tracing the flow of data and catching major bugs that can be missed with traditional forms of static analysis.

“Every finding goes through a multi-stage verification process before it reaches an analyst. Claude re-examines each result, attempting to prove or disprove its own findings and filter out false positives,” the company claimed. “Findings are also assigned severity ratings so teams can focus on the most important fixes first.”

Threat researchers have told CyberScoop that while the cybersecurity capabilities have clearly improved in recent years, they tend to be most effective at finding lower impact bugs, while experienced human operators are still needed in many organizations to manage the model and deal with higher-level threats and vulnerabilities.

But tools like Claude Opus and XBOW have shown the ability to unearth hundreds of software vulnerabilities, in some cases making the discovery and patching process exponentially faster than it was under a team of humans.

Anthropic said Claude Opus 4.6 is “notably better” at finding high-severity vulnerabilities than past models, in some cases identifying flaws that “had gone undetected for decades.”

Interested users can apply for access to the program. Anthropic clarifies on its sign up page that testers must agree to only use Claude Code Security on code their company owns and “holds all necessary rights to scan,” not third-party owned or licensed code or open source projects.

PayPal app code error leaked personal info and a 'few' unauthorized transactions

About 100 customers affected

PayPal has notified about 100 customers that their personal information was exposed online during a code change gone awry, and in a few of these cases, people saw unauthorized transactions on their accounts.

All of these customers have been fully refunded, according to a PayPal spokesperson.

"When there is a potential exposure of customer information, PayPal is required to notify affected customers," the spokesperson told The Register. "In this case, PayPal's systems were not compromised. As such, we contacted the approximately 100 customers who were potentially impacted to provide awareness on this matter."

According to a February 10 data breach notification sent to affected customers and shared with The Register, the online payment company spotted the unauthorized activity on December 12. It was due to a coding error in its PayPal Working Capital loan application that inadvertently leaked customers' business contact information - including names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, email addresses, phone numbers, and business addresses - between July 1, 2025, and December 13, 2025.

"PayPal has since rolled back the code change responsible for this error, which potentially exposed the PII," the letter said [PDF].

As soon as it noticed the leak and fraudulent transactions, PayPal says it began an investigation and blocked the unauthorized access, resetting passwords of affected accounts and requiring customers to set a new password the next time they log in.

"A few customers experienced unauthorized transactions on their account and PayPal has issued refunds to these customers," according to the notification.

The company is also offering affected customers two years of free credit monitoring.

This data incident follows an earlier - and much worse - PayPal breach that also occurred in December, during which "unauthorized parties" accessed customers' accounts using their valid login credentials.

In that 2022 security snafu, personal info belonging to 35,000 PayPal users was exposed including customers' names, addresses, Social Security numbers, individual tax identification numbers, and dates of birth. ®

Las Vegas hotel and casino giant Wynn Resorts appears to be the latest victim of data-grabbing and extortion gang ShinyHunters.

On Friday, the cybercrime crew listed the hospitality company on its blog, claiming to have stolen more than 800,000 records containing employees' Social Security numbers and other private details. The extortionists set a February 23 deadline for Wynn to "reach out" and threatened to leak the data, "along with several annoying (digital) problems that'll come your way," if the resort chain did not comply with the demands.

Samples of the stolen data seen by The Register contain employees' full names, emails, phone numbers, positions, salaries, start dates, birthdays, and other personal information.

Wynn Resorts, which owns five resorts, 81 restaurants, and 200 high-end retail outlets, did not immediately respond to The Register's inquiries. We will update this story when we hear back from the company.

ShinyHunters set a fee of 22.34 Bitcoin (about $1.5 million) as the "starting price" for the stolen files, according to a spokesperson for the crime group, who told The Register that the digital intruders gained initial access to Wynn's systems in September 2025 via an Oracle PeopleSoft vulnerability using an employee's credentials.

Shiny declined to say if it got the Wynn employee to give up the credentials via a social engineering trick, or simply paid the individual for access. The group has previously used Telegram to solicit insider access, and in one case reportedly claimed it agreed to pay a CrowdStrike employee $25,000 for access, though the security shop said no systems were breached.

The claimed Wynn Resorts breach follows a slew of recent ShinyHunters intrusions, several of which involved voice phishing to obtain single-sign-on codes from users of Okta, Microsoft, and Google services.

It's also notable that nearly three years ago, a group with ties to ShinyHunters' crime collaborative hacked two other major Vegas hotel and casino chains: Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts.

In late 2023, Scattered Spider abused Okta SSO codes and help-desk calls to break into both resort chains' networks, deployed ransomware on their networks, and stole data belonging to tens of thousands of customers.

In September 2025, Las Vegas cops cuffed a teen linked to the casino hacks shortly after British police arrested two other teens accused of being members of the notorious cybercrime gang.

At least seven other suspected Scattered Spider members were arrested in 2024 as part of wider probes following the Las Vegas resort intrusions.  ®

[11] TechCrunch Security - Ukrainian man jailed for identity theft that helped North Koreans get jobs at US companies

A U.S. federal court has sentenced a Ukrainian man to five years in prison for his part in a long-running identity theft operation that helped overseas North Korean workers gain fraudulent employment at dozens of U.S. companies.

U.S. prosecutors brought charges in 2024 against Oleksandr Didenko, 29, a resident of Kyiv, for setting up North Koreans with stolen identities of U.S. citizens to get hired and earn a wage. Under this scheme, the workers’ earnings were funneled back to Pyongyang, which the regime used to fund its internationally sanctioned nuclear weapons program.

This is the latest in a string of recent convictions of individuals involved in facilitating ongoing North Korean so-called “IT worker” schemes. Security researchers have described North Korean workers as a “triple threat” to U.S. and Western businesses, as they violate U.S. sanctions, all the while enabling North Koreans to steal sensitive company data, and then later extort those victim companies into not publicly releasing corporate secrets.

Prosecutors said Didenko ran a website called Upworksell, which allowed people working overseas, including North Koreans, to buy or rent stolen identities for gaining employment with U.S. firms. Didenko handled more than 870 stolen identities, per the Justice Department.

The FBI seized Upworksell in 2024 and diverted its traffic to its own servers. Polish authorities arrested Didenko, who was then extradited to the U.S. and later pleaded guilty.

In a statement this week, the U.S. Department of Justice said Didenko also paid people to receive and host computers at their homes in California, Tennessee, and Virginia. These “laptop farms” are rooms containing racks of open laptops, allowing North Koreans to remotely perform their work as if they were physically in the United States.

Security giant CrowdStrike said last year that it has seen a sharp rise in the number of North Korean workers infiltrating companies, often as remote developers or other technical software engineering jobs. The scheme is among many that the North Korean regime uses to enrich itself, while unable to use the global financial system, thanks to international sanctions.

North Koreans are also known to impersonate recruiters and VCs in efforts to trick unsuspecting high-profile and high-net-worth victims into granting access to their computers, including crypto.

[12] CSO Online - Compromised npm package silently installs OpenClaw on developer machines

Compromised npm package silently installs OpenClaw on developer machines

While the AI itself wasn’t weaponized, the technique raises concerns about AI agents with broad system access.

A new security bypass has users installing AI agent OpenClaw — whether they intended to or not.

Researchers have discovered that a compromised npm publish token pushed an update for the widely-used Cline command line interface (CLI) containing a malicious postinstall script. That script installs the wildly popular, but increasingly condemned, agentic application OpenClaw on the unsuspecting user’s machine.

This can be extremely dangerous, as OpenClaw has broad system access and deep integrations with messaging platforms including WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, iMessage, Teams, and others.

According to research by security platform Socket, the script was live for eight hours on the registry.

It should be emphasized that, in this case, OpenClaw wasn’t inherently malicious. However, it does represent yet another chapter in OpenClaw’s shaky security saga, and situations like this could earn it ‘potentially unwanted application’ (PUA) status.

“I mean, they effectively turned OpenClaw into malware that EDR [endpoint detection and response ] isn’t going to stop,” said David Shipley of Beauceron Security. It is “deviously, terrifyingly brilliant.”

Users love OpenClaw; attackers do, too

OpenClaw (formerly Clawdbot and Moltbot) is a free, open-source, autonomous AI agent that launched on January 29 and almost immediately went viral. According to its developer, Peter Steinberger, its repo had more than 2 million visitors over the course of a single week, and it’s estimated that it has been downloaded 720,000 times a week.

OpenClaw runs locally on a user’s hardware rather than in the cloud, and can perform autonomous, real-world actions on their behalf, such as reading emails, browsing web pages, running apps, or managing calendars.

However, almost immediately after release, it raised serious security issues: It is prone to prompt injection attacks, authentication bypasses, and server-side request forgery (SSRF), among other attacks. Many enterprises have responded by severely restricting, or outright banning, the AI agent.

While, in the Cline situation, it was merely installed, but not inherently malicious, “the attacker had the ability to install anything,” Socket’s Sarah Gooding wrote. “This time it was OpenClaw. Next time it might be something malicious.”

The Cline CLI is widely-used across the developer ecosystem, with about 90,000 weekly downloads from npm. The compromised token pushed cline@2.3.0, which contained a modified package.json with a postinstall script that installed the latest version of OpenClaw, to the npm registry. The addition of that script was the only modification to the package; otherwise the CLI binary and other contents were identical to the legitimate prior release, Gooding noted, making it easy to miss.

The compromised package was pushed on February 17, although the underlying problem had been discovered six weeks prior by security researcher Adnan Khan. The package sat live on the registry for an estimated eight hours before it was deprecated and Cline published a corrected version (2.4.0).

Khan had initially published his research about the vulnerable workflow on February 9, after unsuccessful attempts to get a response to his reports from Cline, and Cline fixed it within 30 minutes. However, while the patch closed the entry point, the token could have been stolen during an attacker’s initial reconnaissance, meaning the fix came too late to prevent the February 17 publish (which, ultimately, was the day it was exploited).

“Cline had no prior install scripts, so a new one appearing was an anomalous signal worth investigating,” Gooding noted, adding that Socket has marked the unauthorized publish as malware.

For devs who installed or updated the Cline CLI in the roughly eight-hour window on February 17, Socket advises:

Update to the latest version: npm install “-g cline@latest.”

If on version 2.3.0, update to 2.4.0 or higher.

Check for and immediately remove OpenClaw if it hadn’t been intentionally installed (“npm uninstall -g openclaw”).

Gooding noted, “nothing ran automatically beyond the install,” but added there was still a risk: “OpenClaw is a capable agentic tool with broad system permissions, not a trivial package to have silently dropped onto a developer’s machine.”

EDR, managed detection and response (MDR), and other security providers are going to be forced to declare OpenClaw as either a PUA or “flat out as malware, which, honestly, it can be,” said Shipley, or these kinds of attack win.

“I hate to give it to attackers, but you kind of have to on this one,” he said. “This is why agentic AI is going to get so many people pwned.”

Ultimately, it’s a no-win scenario, Shipley noted, particularly if any organization was “so foolish” as to have allowed OpenClaw into their enterprise environment and built business-reliant work processes on it.

As he put it: “Attackers combined the two biggest dumpster fires in 2026 cybersecurity into a city-scale landfill fire by chaining supply chain hacks via npm and the smoking-hot-vibe-coded AI agent disaster of OpenClaw.”

[13] CSO Online - Don’t trust TrustConnect: This fake remote support tool only helps hackers

Don’t trust TrustConnect: This fake remote support tool only helps hackers

A fake remote monitoring tool, supported by a subscription service and a website used to promote it, is used to manage compromised systems.

After breaking into a system, crooks often install legitimate remote admin tools to keep a foothold on the network — with the risk that the tool’s vendor spots them and locks them out. Now they have a new option: a fake remote monitoring and management (RMM) tool, complete with serious-looking online storefront, built just for them.

“TrustConnect,” the malware-as-a-service (MaaS) spotted by researchers at Proofpoint, has a website to promote it and all the support infrastructure necessary to manage compromised machines. A subscription to it is advertised at $300 per month.

Proofpoint disrupted some of the malware’s infrastructure with help from intelligence partners, the company said in a blogpost, “But the actor demonstrated resilience, with another fake RMM website identified shortly before publication that advertised malware called DocConnect.”

The researchers noted links between the TrustConnect operation and activity involving the RedLine stealer, based on malware characteristics and their own intelligence.

Social engineering for initial access

Victims are tricked into installing TrustConnect under the pretense of legitimate remote support, Proofpoint said. Rather than exploiting vulnerabilities for silent deployment, the attackers depend on user interaction to execute the program.

“Threat actors distributing TrustConnect have used a variety of lure themes including taxes, document shares, meeting invitations, events, and government themes,” the researchers wrote. The MaaS offers its customers varying templates depending on intended brand abuse: “Beginning on 26 January we observed a campaign purporting to be invitations for bids and to an event. Messages were sent from compromised senders and email body copy included both English and French.”

The attackers have also created signed executables that impersonate installers for widely used software such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Adobe Reader, and Google Meet, with matching icons and metadata. Victims are encouraged to download them by clicking on a link in an email, which then automatically registers infected systems in the operator’s control panel on the TrustConnect website, essentially making TrustConnect a remote access trojan (RAT).

In one particular campaign leveraging a single compromised sender, lures included URLs leading to ScreenConnect installation from Jan. 31 to Feb. 1, and then on Feb. 3 to TrustConnect and LogMeln Resolve installations.

Attackers use a dual-purpose website

The TrustConnect website has realistic marketing language, feature descriptions, and documentation that serves both as a public-facing front to promote the software and as a backend portal for customers who purchase access to the tool’s malicious services.

“Cybercriminals are instructed to sign up for a ‘free trial,’ instructed on how to pay in cryptocurrency, and then verify payment in the TrustConnect portal,” the researchers said, adding that the customers are charged $300 per month for a web-based C2 dashboard with a list of devices that have the RAT installed. A subscription allows executing commands, transferring files and connecting remotely to the infected devices.

The trustconnectsoftware[.]com domain was created on Jan. 12, 2026.

“The malware creator (also) uses the domain as the ‘business website’ designed to convince the public (including certificate providers) that the software is a legitimate RMM app, providing fake details like customer statistics and software documentation,” Proofpoint researchers wrote.

Proofpoint suspects the actor used large language models (LLMs) to create TrustConnect. It shared a list of indicator URLs to support detection efforts, warning that TrustConnect has potential to become a full-blown campaign, now with a more advanced variant, DocConnect.
