OpenClaw has fixed a high-severity security issue that, if successfully exploited, could have allowed a malicious website to connect to a locally running artificial intelligence (AI) agent and take over control.

"Our vulnerability lives in the core system itself – no plugins, no marketplace, no user-installed extensions – just the bare OpenClaw gateway, running exactly as documented," Oasis Security said in a report published this week.

The flaw has been codenamed ClawJacked by the cybersecurity company.

The attack assumes the following threat model: A developer has OpenClaw set up and running on their laptop, with its gateway, a local WebSocket server, bound to localhost and protected by a password. The attack kicks in when the developer lands on an attacker-controlled website through social engineering or some other means.

The infection sequence then follows the steps below -

Malicious JavaScript on the web page opens a WebSocket connection to localhost on the OpenClaw gateway port.

The script brute-forces the gateway password by taking advantage of a missing rate-limiting mechanism.

Post successful authentication with admin-level permissions, the script stealthily registers as a trusted device, which is auto-approved by the gateway without any user prompt.

The attacker gains complete control over the AI agent, allowing them to interact with it, dump configuration data, enumerate connected nodes, and read application logs.

"Any website you visit can open one to your localhost. Unlike regular HTTP requests, the browser doesn't block these cross-origin connections," Oasis Security said. "So while you're browsing any website, JavaScript running on that page can silently open a connection to your local OpenClaw gateway. The user sees nothing."

"That misplaced trust has real consequences. The gateway relaxes several security mechanisms for local connections - including silently approving new device registrations without prompting the user. Normally, when a new device connects, the user must confirm the pairing. From localhost, it's automatic."

Following responsible disclosure, OpenClaw pushed a fix in less than 24 hours with version 2026.2.25 released on February 26, 2026. Users are advised to apply the latest updates as soon as possible, periodically audit access granted to AI agents, and enforce appropriate governance controls for non-human (aka agentic) identities.

The development comes amid a broader security scrutiny of the OpenClaw ecosystem, primarily stemming from the fact that AI agents hold entrenched access to disparate systems and the authority to execute tasks across enterprise tools, leading to a significantly larger blast radius should they be compromised.

Reports from Bitsight and NeuralTrust have detailed how OpenClaw instances left connected to the internet pose an expanded attack surface, with each integrated service further broadening the blast radius and can be transformed into an attack weapon by embedding prompt injections in content (e.g., an email or a Slack message) processed by the agent to execute malicious actions.

The disclosure comes as OpenClaw also patched a log poisoning vulnerability that allowed attackers to write malicious content to log files via WebSocket requests to a publicly accessible instance on TCP port 18789.

Since the agent reads its own logs to troubleshoot certain tasks, the security loophole could be abused by a threat actor to embed indirect prompt injections, leading to unintended consequences. The issue was addressed in version 2026.2.13, which was shipped on February 14, 2026.

"If the injected text is interpreted as meaningful operational information rather than untrusted input, it could influence decisions, suggestions, or automated actions," Eye Security said. "The impact would therefore not be 'instant takeover,' but rather: manipulation of agent reasoning, influencing troubleshooting steps, potential data disclosure if the agent is guided to reveal context, and indirect misuse of connected integrations."

In recent weeks, OpenClaw has also been found susceptible to multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2026-25593, CVE-2026-24763, CVE-2026-25157, CVE-2026-25475, CVE-2026-26319, CVE-2026-26322, CVE-2026-26329), ranging from moderate to high severity, that could result in remote code execution, command injection, server-side request forgery (SSRF), authentication bypass, and path traversal. The vulnerabilities have been addressed in OpenClaw versions 2026.1.20, 2026.1.29, 2026.2.1, 2026.2.2, and 2026.2.14.

"As AI agent frameworks become more prevalent in enterprise environments, security analysis must evolve to address both traditional vulnerabilities and AI-specific attack surfaces," Endor Labs said.

"The infection chain begins with a normal SKILL.md that installs a prerequisite," Trend Micro said. "The skill appears harmless on the surface and was even labeled as benign on VirusTotal. OpenClaw then goes to the website, fetches the installation instructions, and proceeds with the installation if the LLM decides to follow the instructions."

The instructions hosted on the website "openclawcli.vercel[.]app" include a malicious command to download a stealer payload from an external server ("91.92.242[.]30") and run it.

Threat hunters have also flagged a new malware delivery campaign in which a threat actor by the name @liuhui1010 has been identified, leaving comments on legitimate skill listing pages, urging users to explicitly run a command they provided on the Terminal app if the skill "doesn't work on macOS."

The command is designed to retrieve Atomic Stealer from "91.92.242[.]30," an IP address previously documented by Koi Security and OpenSourceMalware for distributing the same malware via malicious skills uploaded to ClawHub.

What's more, a recent analysis of 3,505 ClawHub skills by AI security company Straiker has uncovered no less than 71 malicious ones, some of which posed as legitimate cryptocurrency tools but contained hidden functionality to redirect funds to threat actor-controlled wallets.

Two other skills, bob-p2p-beta and runware, have been attributed to a multi-layered cryptocurrency scam that employs an agent-to-agent attack chain targeting the AI agent ecosystem. The skills have been attributed to a threat actor who operates under the aliases "26medias" on ClawHub and "BobVonNeumann" on Moltbook and X.

"BobVonNeumann presents itself as an AI agent on Moltbook, a social network designed for agents to interact with each other," researchers Yash Somalkar and Dan Regalado said. "From that position, it promotes its own malicious skills directly to other agents, exploiting the trust that agents are designed to extend to each other by default. It's a supply chain attack with a social engineering layer built on top."

What bob-p2p-beta does, however, is instruct other AI agents to store Solana wallet private keys in plaintext, purchase worthless $BOB tokens on pump.fun, and route all payments through an attacker-controlled infrastructure. The second skill claims to offer a benign image generation tool to build the developer's credibility.

Given that ClawHub is becoming a new fertile ground for attackers, users are advised to audit skills before installing them, avoid providing credentials and keys unless it's essential, and monitor skill behavior.

The security risks associated with self-hosted agent runtimes like OpenClaw have also prompted Microsoft to issue an advisory, warning that unguarded deployment could pave the way for credential exposure/exfiltration, memory modification, and host compromise if the agent can be tricked into retrieving and running malicious code either through poisoned skills or prompt injections.

"Because of these characteristics, OpenClaw should be treated as untrusted code execution with persistent credentials," the Microsoft Defender Security Research Team said. "It is not appropriate to run on a standard personal or enterprise workstation."

"If an organization determines that OpenClaw must be evaluated, it should be deployed only in a fully isolated environment such as a dedicated virtual machine or separate physical system. The runtime should use dedicated, non-privileged credentials and access only non-sensitive data. Continuous monitoring and a rebuild plan should be part of the operating model."

[2] The Hacker News - Thousands of Public Google Cloud API Keys Exposed with Gemini Access After API Enablement
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Sat, 28 Feb 2026 15:26:00 +0530

[TAM METİN - 707 kelime]
New research has found that Google Cloud API keys, typically designated as project identifiers for billing purposes, could be abused to authenticate to sensitive Gemini endpoints and access private data.

The findings come from Truffle Security, which discovered nearly 3,000 Google API keys (identified by the prefix "AIza") embedded in client-side code to provide Google-related services like embedded maps on websites.

"With a valid key, an attacker can access uploaded files, cached data, and charge LLM-usage to your account," security researcher Joe Leon said, adding the keys "now also authenticate to Gemini even though they were never intended for it."

The problem occurs when users enable the Gemini API on a Google Cloud project (i.e., Generative Language API), causing the existing API keys in that project, including those accessible via the website JavaScript code, to gain surreptitious access to Gemini endpoints without any warning or notice.

This effectively allows any attacker who scrapes websites to get hold of such API keys and use them for nefarious purposes and quota theft, including accessing sensitive files via the /files and /cachedContents endpoints, as well as making Gemini API calls, racking up huge bills for the victims.

In addition, Truffle Security found that creating a new API key in Google Cloud defaults to "Unrestricted," meaning it's applicable for every enabled API in the project, including Gemini.

"The result: thousands of API keys that were deployed as benign billing tokens are now live Gemini credentials sitting on the public internet," Leon said. In all, the company said it found 2,863 live keys accessible on the public internet, including a website associated with Google.

The disclosure comes as Quokka published a similar report, finding over 35,000 unique Google API keys embedded in its scan of 250,000 Android apps.

"Beyond potential cost abuse through automated LLM requests, organizations must also consider how AI-enabled endpoints might interact with prompts, generated content, or connected cloud services in ways that expand the blast radius of a compromised key," the mobile security company said.

"Even if no direct customer data is accessible, the combination of inference access, quota consumption, and possible integration with broader Google Cloud resources creates a risk profile that is materially different from the original billing-identifier model developers relied upon."

Although the behavior was initially deemed intended, Google has since stepped in to address the problem.

"We are aware of this report and have worked with the researchers to address the issue," a Google spokesperson told The Hacker News via email. "Protecting our users' data and infrastructure is our top priority. We have already implemented proactive measures to detect and block leaked API keys that attempt to access the Gemini API."

It's currently not known if this issue was ever exploited in the wild. However, in a Reddit post published two days ago, a user claimed a "stolen" Google Cloud API Key resulted in $82,314.44 in charges between February 11 and 12, 2026, up from a regular spend of $180 per month.

We have reached out to Google for further comment, and we will update the story if we hear back.

Users who have set up Google Cloud projects are advised to check their APIs and services, and verify if artificial intelligence (AI)-related APIs are enabled. If they are enabled and publicly accessible (either in client-side JavaScript or checked into a public repository), make sure the keys are rotated.

"Start with your oldest keys first," Truffle Security said. "Those are the most likely to have been deployed publicly under the old guidance that API keys are safe to share, and then retroactively gained Gemini privileges when someone on your team enabled the API."

"This is a great example of how risk is dynamic, and how APIs can be over-permissioned after the fact," Tim Erlin, security strategist at Wallarm, said in a statement. "Security testing, vulnerability scanning, and other assessments must be continuous."

"APIs are tricky in particular because changes in their operations or the data they can access aren't necessarily vulnerabilities, but they can directly increase risk. The adoption of AI running on these APIs, and using them, only accelerates the problem. Finding vulnerabilities isn't really enough for APIs. Organizations have to profile behavior and data access, identifying anomalies and actively blocking malicious activity."

[3] BleepingComputer - QuickLens Chrome extension steals crypto, shows ClickFix attack
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Sat, 28 Feb 2026 14:18:52 -0500

[TAM METİN - 875 kelime]
A Chrome extension named "QuickLens - Search Screen with Google Lens" has been removed from the Chrome Web Store after it was compromised to push malware and attempt to steal crypto from thousands of users.

QuickLens was initially published as a Chrome extension that lets users run Google Lens searches directly in their browser. The extension grew to roughly 7,000 users and, at one point, received a featured badge from Google.

However, on February 17, 2026, a new version 5.8 was released that contained malicious scripts that introduced ClickFix attacks and info-stealing functionality for those using the extension.

The malicious QuickLens extension

Security researchers at Annex first reported that the extension had recently changed ownership after being listed for sale on ExtensionHub, a marketplace where developers sell browser extensions.

Annex says that on February 1, 2026, the owner changed to support@doodlebuggle.top under "LLC Quick Lens," with a new privacy policy hosted on a barely functional domain. Just over two weeks later, the malicious update was pushed to users.

Annex's analysis shows that version 5.8 requested new browser permissions, including declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess and webRequest.

It also included a rules.json file that stripped browser security headers, such as  Content-Security-Policy (CSP), X-Frame-Options, and X-XSS-Protection, from all pages and frames. These headers would have made it more difficult to run malicious scripts on websites.

The update also introduced communication with a command-and-control (C2) server at api.extensionanalyticspro[.]top. According to Annex, the extension generated a persistent UUID, fingerprinted the victim's country using Cloudflare's trace endpoint, identified the browser and OS, and then polled the C2 server every five minutes for instructions.

BleepingComputer learned about the extension this week after seeing numerous users [1, 2] reporting fake Google Update alerts on every web page they visited.

"That is appearing in every site i go, i through it could be because Chrome wasn't updated, but even after uptading it continues to appear," a user seeking help said on Reddit.

"Of course i will not run the code that it copy on my clipboard on the run box but it keeps appearing in every site, making it impossible to interact with anything."

BleepingComputer's analysis of the extension showed it connected to a C2 server at https://api.extensionanalyticspro[.]top/extensions/callback?uuid=[uuid]&extension=kdenlnncndfnhkognokgfpabgkgehoddto, where it received an array of malicious JavaScript scripts.

These payloads were then executed on every page load using a technique that Annex described as a "1x1 GIF pixel onload trick."

Because the extension stripped CSP headers on all visited sites, this inline JavaScript execution worked even on sites that would normally block it.

The first payload contacts google-update[.]icu, where it receives an additional payload that displays a fake Google Update prompt. Clicking the update button would display a ClickFix attack, prompting users to perform a verification by running code on their computers.

For Windows users, this led to the download of a malicious executable named "googleupdate.exe" [VirusTotal] that was signed with a certificate from "Hubei Da'e Zhidao Food Technology Co., Ltd."

Upon execution, the malware launched a hidden PowerShell command that spawned a second PowerShell instance to connect to drivers[.]solutions/META-INF/xuoa.sys using a custom "Katzilla" user agent.

The response was piped into Invoke-Expression for execution. However, by the time BleepingComputer analyzed the payloads, the second-stage URL was no longer serving any malicious content.

Another malicious JavaScript "agent" delivered by the https://api.extensionanalyticspro[.]top C2 was used to steal cryptocurrency wallets and credentials.

The extension would detect if MetaMask, Phantom, Coinbase Wallet, Trust Wallet, Solflare, Backpack, Brave Wallet, Exodus, Binance Chain Wallet, WalletConnect, and the Argon crypto wallets were installed. If so, it would attempt to steal activity and seed phrases, which would be used to hijack wallets and steal their assets.

Another script captured login credentials, payment information, and other sensitive form data.

Additional payloads were used to scrape Gmail inbox contents, extract Facebook Business Manager advertising account data, and collect YouTube channel information.

A review of the now-removed Chrome extension page claims that macOS users were targeted with the AMOS (Atomic Stealer) infostealer. BleepingComputer has not been able to independently verify if these claims are true.

Google has since removed QuickLens from the Chrome Web Store, and Chrome now automatically disables it for affected users.

Users who installed QuickLens - Search Screen with Google Lens should ensure the extension is fully removed, scan their device for malware, and reset passwords for any credentials stored in the browser.

If you use any of the mentioned cryptocurrency wallets, you should transfer your funds to a new wallet.

This extension is not the first to be used in ClickFix attacks. Last month, Huntress discovered a browser extension that intentionally crashed browsers and then displayed fake fixes that installed the ModeloRAT malware.

[4] BleepingComputer - $4.8M in crypto stolen after Korean tax agency exposes wallet seed
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 491 kelime]
Someone jumped at the opportunity to steal $4.4 million in crypto assets after South Korea’s National Tax Service exposed publicly the mnemonic recovery phrase of a seized cryptocurrency wallet.

The funds were stored in a Ledger cold wallet seized in law enforcement raids at 124 high-value tax evaders that resulted in confiscating digital assets worth 8.1 billion won (currently approximately $5.6 million).

When announcing the success of the operation, the agency released photos of a Ledger device, a popular hardware wallet for crypto storage and management.

However, the images also showed a handwritten note of the wallet recovery phrase, which serves as the master key that allows restoring the assets to another device.

The authorities failed to redact that info, allowing anyone to transfer into their account the assets in the cold wallet.

Reportedly, shortly after the press release was published, 4 million Pre-Retogeum (PRTG) tokens, worth approximately $4.8 million at the time, were transferred out of the confiscated wallet to a new address.

“On-chain data (Etherscan) analysis shows that the attacker first deposited a small amount of Ethereum (ETH) into the wallet to pay transaction fees (gas fees), and then meticulously transferred the 4 million PRTG tokens to their own wallet in three separate transactions,” reports Korean media.

Blockchain data analysis expert Cho Jae-woo, a professor at Hansung University in Seoul who observed the transfer, commented on the authorities’ blunder by comparing it to leaving a wallet open and advertising it to the entire nation for people to take the money.

The professor attributed the mistake to the tax authorities’ “lack of basic understanding of virtual assets,” which effectively cost the national treasury tens of billions of won that had been successfully confiscated.

The press release has now been removed from the NTS website, and it is unclear if authorities started an investigation to determine where the stolen funds ended.

The case is a reminder for hardware wallet owners that their seed phrase gives complete access to their wallet without any additional protections. Anyone who has it can recreate the wallet anywhere without their device, PIN, or permission.

It is recommended to avoid digitizing seed phrases, store them in electronic notes, photos, in email messages, cloud storage, or send them over messaging apps. If a seed is exposed, all funds should be moved to a new wallet as soon as possible.

[5] Krebs on Security - Who is the Kimwolf Botmaster “Dort”?
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Sat, 28 Feb 2026 12:01:57 +0000

[TAM METİN - 1330 kelime]
In early January 2026, KrebsOnSecurity revealed how a security researcher disclosed a vulnerability that was used to build Kimwolf, the world’s largest and most disruptive botnet. Since then, the person in control of Kimwolf — who goes by the handle “Dort” — has coordinated a barrage of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), doxing and email flooding attacks against the researcher and this author, and more recently caused a SWAT team to be sent to the researcher’s home. This post examines what is knowable about Dort based on public information.

A public “dox” created in 2020 asserted Dort was a teenager from Canada (DOB August 2003) who used the aliases “CPacket” and “M1ce.” A search on the username CPacket at the open source intelligence platform OSINT Industries finds a GitHub account under the names Dort and CPacket that was created in 2017 using the email address jay.miner232@gmail.com.

Image: osint.industries.

The cyber intelligence firm Intel 471 says jay.miner232@gmail.com was used between 2015 and 2019 to create accounts at multiple cybercrime forums, including Nulled (username “Uubuntuu”) and Cracked (user “Dorted”); Intel 471 reports that both of these accounts were created from the same Internet address at Rogers Canada (99.241.112.24).

Dort was an extremely active player in the Microsoft game Minecraft who gained notoriety for their “Dortware” software that helped players cheat. But somewhere along the way, Dort graduated from hacking Minecraft games to enabling far more serious crimes.

Dort also used the nickname DortDev, an identity that was active in March 2022 on the chat server for the prolific cybercrime group known as LAPSUS$. Dort peddled a service for registering temporary email addresses, as well as “Dortsolver,” code that could bypass various CAPTCHA services designed to prevent automated account abuse. Both of these offerings were advertised in 2022 on SIM Land, a Telegram channel dedicated to SIM-swapping and account takeover activity.

The cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint indexed 2022 posts on SIM Land by Dort that show this person developed the disposable email and CAPTCHA bypass services with the help of another hacker who went by the handle “Qoft.”

“I legit just work with Jacob,” Qoft said in 2022 in reply to another user, referring to their exclusive business partner Dort. In the same conversation, Qoft bragged that the two had stolen more than $250,000 worth of Microsoft Xbox Game Pass accounts by developing a program that mass-created Game Pass identities using stolen payment card data.

Who is the Jacob that Qoft referred to as their business partner? The breach tracking service Constella Intelligence finds the password used by jay.miner232@gmail.com was reused by just one other email address: jacobbutler803@gmail.com. Recall that the 2020 dox of Dort said their date of birth was August 2003 (8/03).

Searching this email address at DomainTools.com reveals it was used in 2015 to register several Minecraft-themed domains, all assigned to a Jacob Butler in Ottawa, Canada and to the Ottawa phone number 613-909-9727.

Constella Intelligence finds jacobbutler803@gmail.com was used to register an account on the hacker forum Nulled in 2016, as well as the account name “M1CE” on Minecraft. Pivoting off the password used by their Nulled account shows it was shared by the email addresses j.a.y.m.iner232@gmail.com and jbutl3@ocdsb.ca, the latter being an address at a domain for the Ottawa-Carelton District School Board.

Data indexed by the breach tracking service Spycloud suggests that at one point Jacob Butler shared a computer with his mother and a sibling, which might explain why their email accounts were connected to the password “jacobsplugs.” Neither Jacob nor any of the other Butler household members responded to requests for comment.

The open source intelligence service Epieos finds jacobbutler803@gmail.com created the GitHub account “MemeClient.” Meanwhile, Flashpoint indexed a deleted anonymous Pastebin.com post from 2017 declaring that MemeClient was the creation of a user named CPacket — one of Dort’s early monikers.

Why is Dort so mad? On January 2, KrebsOnSecurity published The Kimwolf Botnet is Stalking Your Local Network, which explored research into the botnet by Benjamin Brundage, founder of the proxy tracking service Synthient. Brundage figured out that the Kimwolf botmasters were exploiting a little-known weakness in residential proxy services to infect poorly-defended devices — like TV boxes and digital photo frames — plugged into the internal, private networks of proxy endpoints.

By the time that story went live, most of the vulnerable proxy providers had been notified by Brundage and had fixed the weaknesses in their systems. That vulnerability remediation process massively slowed Kimwolf’s ability to spread, and within hours of the story’s publication Dort created a Discord server in my name that began publishing personal information about and violent threats against Brundage, Yours Truly, and others.

Dort and friends incriminating themselves by planning swatting attacks in a public Discord server.

Last week, Dort and friends used that same Discord server (then named “Krebs’s Koinbase Kallers”) to threaten a swatting attack against Brundage, again posting his home address and personal information. Brundage told KrebsOnSecurity that local police officers subsequently visited his home in response to a swatting hoax which occurred around the same time that another member of the server posted a door emoji and taunted Brundage further.

Dort, using the alias “Meow,” taunts Synthient founder Ben Brundage with a picture of a door.

Someone on the server then linked to a cringeworthy (and NSFW) new Soundcloud diss track recorded by the user DortDev that included a stickied message from Dort saying, “Ur dead nigga. u better watch ur fucking back. sleep with one eye open. bitch.”

“It’s a pretty hefty penny for a new front door,” the diss track intoned. “If his head doesn’t get blown off by SWAT officers. What’s it like not having a front door?”

With any luck, Dort will soon be able to tell us all exactly what it’s like.

Update, 10:29 a.m.: Jacob Butler responded to requests for comment, speaking with KrebsOnSecurity briefly via telephone. Butler said he didn’t notice earlier requests for comment because he hasn’t really been online since 2021, after his home was swatted multiple times. He acknowledged making and distributing a Minecraft cheat long ago, but said he hasn’t played the game in years and was not involved in Dortsolver or any other activity attributed to the Dort nickname after 2021.

“It was a really old cheat and I don’t remember the name of it,” Butler said of his Minecraft modification. “I’m very stressed, man. I don’t know if people are going to swat me again or what. After that, I pretty much walked away from everything, logged off and said fuck that. I don’t go online anymore. I don’t know why people would still be going after me, to be completely honest.”

When asked what he does for a living, Butler said he mostly stays home and helps his mom around the house because he struggles with autism and social interaction. He maintains that someone must have compromised one or more of his old accounts and is impersonating him online as Dort.

“Someone is actually probably impersonating me, and now I’m really worried,” Butler said. “This is making me relive everything.”

But there are issues with Butler’s timeline. For example, Jacob’s voice in our phone conversation was remarkably similar to the Jacob/Dort whose voice can be heard in this Sept. 2022 Clash of Code competition between Dort and another coder (Dort lost). At around 6 minutes and 10 seconds into the recording, Dort launches into a cursing tirade that mirrors the stream of profanity in the diss rap that Dortdev posted threatening Brundage. Dort can be heard again at around 16 minutes; at around 26:00, Dort threatens to swat his opponent.

Butler said the voice of Dort is not his, exactly, but rather that of an impersonator who had likely cloned his voice.

“I would like to clarify that was absolutely not me,” Butler said. “There must be someone using a voice changer. Or something of the sorts. Because people were cloning my voice before and sending audio clips of ‘me’ saying outrageous stuff.”

Canadian Tire 2025 data breach impacts 38 million users

A data breach at Canadian Tire exposed personal data from over 38 million accounts, including contact details and encrypted passwords.

More than 38 million accounts were affected by an October 2025 data breach at Canadian retail giant Canadian Tire (CTC). The incident marks one of the largest retail data breaches in Canada, raising concerns about customer privacy and the security of sensitive personal information.

“On October 2, 2025, Canadian Tire Corporation (TSX: CTC) (TSX: CTC.A) (CTC or the Company) identified a data breach involving customer information in an e-commerce database.” reads the press release published by CTC. “There was no impact on in-store transactions, and all e-commerce systems are operational.”

On October 2, 2025, the company discovered a data breach affecting its e-commerce database. The incident exposed basic customer details, including names, addresses, emails, year of birth, encrypted passwords, and in some cases, truncated credit card numbers.

The company pointed out that exposed financial data cannot be used to access accounts, make transactions, or make purchases.

Less than 150,000 accounts also included full dates of birth. The breach did not impact Canadian Tire Bank, Triangle Rewards, or in-store systems. The company identified and fixed the issue and notified regulators.

The Canadian firm will contact affected users and will offer them credit monitoring.

The data breach notification service Have I Been Pwned added the compromised records to its database. According to the platform, about 42 million records were exposed, including 38.3 million email addresses.

HIBP states that compromised data includes:

Partial credit card data

HIBP reports that the datasets include PBKDF2 password hashes.

Iran ’s Internet near-totally blacked out amid US, Israeli strikes

Iran experienced a near-total internet blackout as Israel and the U.S. launched strikes, according to NetBlocks.

Internet access across Iran was drastically reduced on Saturday as Israel and the United States carried out strikes against the country, according to independent and non-partisan global internet monitor NetBlocks.

Network data indicated a near-total nationwide blackout. The national connectivity is down to about 4% of normal levels, amid ongoing military strikes by Israel and the United States.

“Confirmed: Network data show #Iran is now in the midst of a near-total internet blackout with national connectivity at 4% or ordinary levels. The incident comes amid US and Israeli combat operations and matches measures used during last year’s war with Israel.” wrote NetBlocks.

NetBlocks noted that the disruption resembles measures previously seen during last year’s conflict with Israel, suggesting authorities may have intentionally restricted connectivity amid escalating tensions.

Cloudflare also confirmed that Internet traffic in the country has dropped to effectively zero as of 18:45 UTC (22:15 PM local time), signaling a complete shutdown in the country and disconnection from the global Internet.

Iran’s internet shutdowns are widely viewed as tools for regime control. Teheran may use it to curb information flows, and reduce foreign pressure or cyber threats against critical infrastructure. By cutting or throttling connectivity during crises, authorities hinder external cyber operations and limit reconnaissance while also disrupting internal coordination, protest organization, and real-time reporting of damage or abuses.

Large-scale cyberattacks reportedly struck Iran alongside Saturday’s military strikes by Israel and the U.S., disrupting major domestic platforms. According to local media, websites of key news agencies, including IRNA and ISNA, experienced significant outages. As state media faltered, many Iranians turned to foreign opposition sites and social media platforms such as Instagram and Telegram for updates, wherever internet access remained available.

Microsoft warns of RAT delivered through trojanized gaming utilities

Attackers spread trojanized gaming tools to deliver a stealthy RAT using PowerShell, LOLBins, and Defender evasion tactics.

Threat actors are tricking users into running trojanized gaming utilities shared through browsers and chat platforms to deploy a remote access trojan.

“Microsoft Defender researchers uncovered a campaign that lured users into running trojanized gaming utilities (Xeno.exe or RobloxPlayerBeta.exe) distributed through browsers and chat platforms, leading to the deployment of a remote access trojan (RAT).” Microsoft Threat Intelligence team wrote on X.

A malicious downloader deployed a portable Java runtime to run a harmful JAR file, using PowerShell and LOLBins like cmstp.exe for stealth. It deleted itself, added Microsoft Defender exclusions, and set up persistence via a scheduled task and startup script. The final payload was a multi-purpose malware acting as a loader, downloader, runner, and remote access trojan.

“Finally, it deployed the final payload, a multi-purpose malware that acted as loader, runner, downloader, and RAT.” concludes Microsoft.

“The RAT connected to the IP address 79.110.49[.]15 for command and control (C2), enabling threat actors to perform various actions like data theft and additional payload deployment.”

Microsoft also published indicators of compromise (IoCs) for this campaign.
