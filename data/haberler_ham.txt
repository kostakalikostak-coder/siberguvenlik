Notepad++ has released a security fix to plug gaps that were exploited by an advanced threat actor from China to hijack the software update mechanism to selectively deliver malware to targets of interest.

The version 8.9.2 update incorporates what maintainer Don Ho calls a "double lock" design that aims to make the update process "robust and effectively unexploitable." This includes verification of the signed installer downloaded from GitHub (implemented in version 8.8.9 and later), as well as the newly added verification of the signed XML returned by the update server at notepad-plus-plus[.]org.

In addition to these enhancements, security-focused changes have been introduced to WinGUp, the auto-updater component -

Removal of libcurl.dll to eliminate DLL side-loading risk

Removal of two unsecured cURL SSL options: CURLSSLOPT_ALLOW_BEAST and CURLSSLOPT_NO_REVOKE

Restriction of plugin management execution to programs signed with the same certificate as WinGUp

The update also addresses a high-severity vulnerability (CVE-2026-25926, CVSS score: 7.3) that could result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the running application.

"An Unsafe Search Path vulnerability (CWE-426) exists when launching Windows Explorer without an absolute executable path," Ho said. "This may allow execution of a malicious explorer.exe if an attacker can control the process working directory. Under certain conditions, this could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the running application."

The development comes weeks after Notepad++ disclosed that a breach at the hosting provider level enabled threat actors to hijack update traffic starting June 2025 and redirect requests from certain users to malicious servers to serve a poisoned update. The issue was detected in early December 2025.

According to Rapid7 and Kaspersky, the tampered updates enabled the attackers to deliver a previously undocumented backdoor dubbed Chrysalis. The supply chain incident, tracked under the CVE identifier CVE-2025-15556 (CVSS score: 7.7), has been attributed to a China-nexus hacking group called Lotus Panda.

Notepad++ users are recommended to update to version 8.9.2, and make sure that the installers are downloaded from the official domain.

[TAM METİN - 406 kelime]
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Tuesday added four security flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation in the wild.

The list of vulnerabilities is as follows -

CVE-2026-2441 (CVSS score: 8.8) - A use-after-free vulnerability in Google Chrome that could allow a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.

CVE-2024-7694 (CVSS score: 7.2) - An arbitrary file upload vulnerability in TeamT5 ThreatSonar Anti-Ransomware versions 3.4.5 and earlier that could allow an attacker to upload malicious files and achieve arbitrary system command execution on the server.

CVE-2020-7796 (CVSS score: 9.8) - A server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Synacor Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS) that could allow an attacker to send a crafted HTTP request to a remote host and obtain unauthorized access to sensitive information.

CVE-2008-0015 (CVSS score: 8.8) - A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in Microsoft Windows Video ActiveX Control that could allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution by setting up a specially crafted web page.

The addition of CVE-2026-2441 to the KEV catalog comes days after Google acknowledged that "an exploit for CVE-2026-2441 exists in the wild." It's currently not known how the vulnerability is being weaponized, but such information is typically withheld until a majority of the users are updated with a fix so as to prevent other threat actors from joining the exploitation bandwagon.

As for CVE-2020-7796, a report published by threat intelligence firm GreyNoise in March 2025 revealed that a cluster of about 400 IP addresses was actively exploiting multiple SSRF vulnerabilities, including CVE-2020-7796, to target susceptible instances in the U.S., Germany, Singapore, India, Lithuania, and Japan.

"When a user visits a web page containing an exploit detected as Exploit:JS/CVE-2008-0015, it may connect to a remote server and download other malware," Microsoft notes in its threat encyclopedia. It also said it's aware of cases where the exploit is used to download and execute Dogkild, a worm that propagates via removable drives.

The worm comes with capabilities to retrieve and run additional binaries, overwrite certain system files, terminate a long list of security-related processes, and even replace the Windows Hosts file in an attempt to prevent users from accessing websites associated with security programs.

It's presently unclear how the TeamT5 ThreatSonar Anti-Ransomware vulnerability is being exploited. Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies are recommended to apply the necessary fixes by March 10, 2026, for optimal protection.

[3] The Hacker News - Researchers Show Copilot and Grok Can Be Abused as Malware C2 Proxies
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 17 Feb 2026 23:38:00 +0530

[TAM METİN - 606 kelime]
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed that artificial intelligence (AI) assistants that support web browsing or URL fetching capabilities can be turned into stealthy command-and-control (C2) relays, a technique that could allow attackers to blend into legitimate enterprise communications and evade detection.

The attack method, which has been demonstrated against Microsoft Copilot and xAI Grok, has been codenamed AI as a C2 proxy by Check Point.

It leverages "anonymous web access combined with browsing and summarization prompts," the cybersecurity company said. "The same mechanism can also enable AI-assisted malware operations, including generating reconnaissance workflows, scripting attacker actions, and dynamically deciding 'what to do next' during an intrusion."

The development signals yet another consequential evolution in how threat actors could abuse AI systems, not just to scale or accelerate different phases of the cyber attack cycle, but also leverage APIs to dynamically generate code at runtime that can adapt its behavior based on information gathered from the compromised host and evade detection.

AI tools already act as a force multiplier for adversaries, allowing them to delegate key steps in their campaigns, whether it be for conducting reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, crafting convincing phishing emails, creating synthetic identities, debugging code, or developing malware. But AI as a C2 proxy goes a step further.

It essentially leverages Grok and Microsoft Copilot's web-browsing and URL-fetch capabilities to retrieve attacker-controlled URLs and return responses through their web interfaces, essentially transforming it into a bidirectional communication channel to accept operator-issued commands and tunnel victim data out.

Notably, all of this works without requiring an API key or a registered account, thereby rendering traditional approaches like key revocation or account suspension useless.

Viewed differently, this approach is no different from attack campaigns that have weaponized trusted services for malware distribution and C2. It's also referred to as living-off-trusted-sites (LOTS).

However, for all this to happen, there is a key prerequisite: the threat actor must have already compromised a machine by some other means and installed malware, which then uses Copilot or Grok as a C2 channel using specially crafted prompts that cause the AI agent to contact the attacker-controlled infrastructure and pass the response containing the command to be executed on the host back to the malware.

Check Point also noted that an attacker could go beyond command generation to make use of the AI agent to devise an evasion strategy and determine the next course of action by passing details about the system and validating if it's even worth exploiting.

"Once AI services can be used as a stealthy transport layer, the same interface can also carry prompts and model outputs that act as an external decision engine, a stepping stone toward AI-Driven implants and AIOps-style C2 that automate triage, targeting, and operational choices in real time," Check Point said.

The disclosure comes weeks after Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 demonstrated a novel attack technique where a seemingly innocuous web page can be turned into a phishing site by using client-side API calls to trusted large language model (LLM) services for generating malicious JavaScript dynamically in real time.

The method is similar to Last Mile Reassembly (LMR) attacks, which involves smuggling malware through the network via unmonitored channels like WebRTC and WebSocket, and piecing them directly in the victim's browser, effectively bypassing security controls in the process.

"Attackers could use carefully engineered prompts to bypass AI safety guardrails, tricking the LLM into returning malicious code snippets," Unit 42 researchers Shehroze Farooqi, Alex Starov, Diva-Oriane Marty, and Billy Melicher said. "These snippets are returned via the LLM service API, then assembled and executed in the victim's browser at runtime, resulting in a fully functional phishing page."

[4] The Hacker News - Keenadu Firmware Backdoor Infects Android Tablets via Signed OTA Updates
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 17 Feb 2026 22:11:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/keenadu-firmware-backdoor-infects.html

[TAM METİN - 1459 kelime]
A new Android backdoor that's embedded deep into the device firmware can silently harvest data and remotely control its behavior, according to new findings from Kaspersky.

The Russian cybersecurity vendor said it discovered the backdoor, dubbed Keenadu, in the firmware of devices associated with various brands, including Alldocube, with the compromise occurring during the firmware build phase. Keenadu has been detected in Alldocube iPlay 50 mini Pro firmware dating back to August 18, 2023. In all cases, the backdoor is embedded within tablet firmware, and the firmware files carry valid digital signatures. The names of the other vendors were not disclosed.

"In several instances, the compromised firmware was delivered with an OTA update," security researcher Dmitry Kalinin said in an exhaustive analysis published today. "A copy of the backdoor is loaded into the address space of every app upon launch. The malware is a multi-stage loader granting its operators the unrestricted ability to control the victim's device remotely."

Some of the payloads retrieved by Keenadu allow it to hijack the search engine in the browser, monetize new app installs, and stealthily interact with ad elements. One of the payloads has been found embedded in several standalone apps distributed via third-party repositories, as well as official app marketplaces like Google Play and Xiaomi GetApps.

Telemetry data suggests that 13,715 users worldwide have encountered Keenadu or its modules, with the majority of the users attacked by the malware located in Russia, Japan, Germany, Brazil, and the Netherlands.

Keenadu was first disclosed by Kaspersky in late December 2025, describing it as a backdoor in libandroid_runtime.so, a critical shared library in the Android operating system that's loaded during boot. Once it's active on an infected device, it's injected into the Zygote process, a behavior also observed in another Android malware called Triada.

The malware is invoked by means of a function call added to the libandroid_runtime.so, following which it checks if it's running within system apps belonging either to Google services or to cellular carriers like Sprint or T-Mobile. If so, the execution is aborted. It also has a kill switch to terminate itself if it finds files with certain names in system directories.

"Next, the Trojan checks if it is running within the system_server process," Kalinin said. "This process controls the entire system and possesses maximum privileges; it is launched by the Zygote process when it starts."

If this check is true, the malware proceeds to create an instance of the AKServer class. Otherwise, it creates an instance of the AKClient class. The AKServer component contains the core logic and command-and-control (C2) mechanism, while AKClient is injected into every app launched on the device and serves as the bridge for interacting with AKServer.

This client-server architecture enables AKServer to execute custom malicious payloads tailored to the specific app it has targeted. AKServer also exposes another interface that malicious modules downloaded within the contexts of other apps can use to grant or revoke permissions to/from an arbitrary app on the device, get the current location, and exfiltrate device information.

The AKServer component is also designed to run a series of checks that cause the malware to terminate if the interface language is Chinese and the device is located within a Chinese time zone, or if Google Play Store or Google Play Services are absent from the device. Once the necessary criteria are satisfied, the Trojan decrypts the C2 address and sends device metadata in encrypted format to the server.

In response, the server returns an encrypted JSON object containing details about the payloads. However, in what appears to be an attempt to complicate analysis and evade detection, an added check built into the backdoor prevents the C2 server from serving any payloads until 2.5 months have elapsed since the initial check-in.

"The attacker's server delivers information about the payloads as an object array," Kaspersky explained. "Each object contains a download link for the payload, its MD5 hash, target app package names, target process names, and other metadata. Notably, the attackers chose Amazon AWS as their CDN provider."

Some of the identified malicious modules are listed below -

Keenadu loader, which targets popular online storefronts like Amazon, Shein, and Temu to deliver unspecified payloads. However, it's suspected that they make it possible to add items to the apps' shopping carts without the victim's knowledge.

Clicker loader, which is injected into YouTube, Facebook, Google Digital Wellbeing, and Android System launcher to deliver payloads that can interact with advertising elements on gaming, recipes, and news websites.

Google Chrome module, which targets the Chrome browser to hijack search requests and redirect them to a different search engine. However, it's worth noting that the hijacking attempt may fail if the victim selects an option from the autocomplete suggestions based on keywords entered in the address bar.

Nova clicker, which is embedded within the system wallpaper picker and uses machine learning and WebRTC to interact with advertising elements. The same component was codenamed Phantom by Doctor Web in an analysis published last month.

Install monetization, which is embedded into the system launcher and monetizes app installations by deceiving advertising platforms into believing that an app was installed from a legitimate ad tap.

Google Play module, which retrieves the Google Ads advertising ID and stores it under the key "S_GA_ID3" for likely use by other modules for uniquely identifying a victim.

Kaspersky said it also identified other Keenadu distribution vectors, including by embedding the Keenadu loader within various system apps, such as the facial recognition service and system launcher, in the firmware of several devices. This tactic has been observed in another Android malware known as Dwphon, which was integrated into system apps responsible for OTA updates.

A second method concerns a Keenadu loader artifact that's designed to operate within a system where the system_server process had already been compromised by a different pre-installed backdoor that shares similarities with BADBOX. That's not all. Keenadu has also been discovered being propagated via trojanized apps for smart cameras on Google Play.

The names of the apps, which were published by a developer named Hangzhou Denghong Technology Co., Ltd., are as follows -

Eoolii (com.taismart.global) - 100,000+ downloads

Ziicam (com.ziicam.aws) - 100,00+ downloads

Eyeplus-Your home in your eyes (com.closeli.eyeplus) - 100,000+ downloads

While these apps are no longer available for download from Google Play, the developer has published the same set of apps to the Apple App Store as well. It's not clear if the iOS counterparts include the Keenadu functionality. The Hacker News has reached out to Kaspersky for comment, and we will update the story if we hear back. That said, it's believed that Keenadu is mainly designed to target Android tablets.

With BADBOX acting as a distribution vector for Keenadu in some cases, further analysis has also uncovered infrastructure connections between Triada and BADBOX, indicating that these botnets are interacting with one another. In March 2025, HUMAN said it identified overlaps between BADBOX and Vo1d, an Android malware targeting off-brand Android-based TV boxes.

The discovery of Keenadu is troubling for two main reasons -

Given that the malware is embedded in libandroid_runtime.so, it operates within the context of every app on the device. This allows it to gain covert access to all data and render Android's app sandboxing ineffective.

The malware's ability to bypass permissions used to control app privileges within the operating system turns it into a backdoor that grants attackers unfettered access and control over the compromised device.

"Developers of pre-installed backdoors in Android device firmware have always stood out for their high level of expertise," Kaspersky concluded. "This is still true for Keenadu: the creators of the malware have a deep understanding of the Android architecture, the app startup process, and the core security principles of the operating system."

"Keenadu is a large-scale, complex malware platform that provides attackers with unrestricted control over the victim’s device. Although we have currently shown that the backdoor is used primarily for various types of ad fraud, we do not rule out that in the future, the malware may follow in Triada’s footsteps and begin stealing credentials."

Following the publication of the story, Google confirmed to The Hacker News that the three identified malicious apps have been removed from Google Play, urging users to ensure that their devices are Play Protect certified. The entire statement from the Google spokesperson has been reproduced verbatim below -

Android users are automatically protected from known versions of this malware by Google Play Protect, which is on by default on Android devices with Google Play Services. Google Play Protect can warn users and disable apps known to exhibit Keenadu-associated behavior, even when those apps come from sources outside of Play. As a best security practice, we recommend users ensure their device is Play Protect certified.

[5] BleepingComputer - Spain orders NordVPN, ProtonVPN to block LaLiga piracy sites
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 17 Feb 2026 18:15:49 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/legal/spain-orders-nordvpn-protonvpn-to-block-laliga-piracy-sites/

[TAM METİN - 654 kelime]
A Spanish court has granted precautionary measures against NordVPN and ProtonVPN, ordering the two popular VPN providers to block 16 websites that facilitate piracy of football matches.

The restrictions will apply to a dynamic list of IP addresses in Spain, and there will be no opportunity for appeals. The measures were taken 'inaudita parte', meaning that the defendants weren’t called to participate in a hearing.

LaLiga - the country’s professional football organizer, and its broadcasting partner, Telefónica, are required to “preserve sufficient digital evidence of the unlawful transmission of the protected contents.”

LaLiga showed a strong stance against the piracy ecosystem in recent years, previously targeting Cloudflare, accusing the internet giant of facilitating illegal sports streaming.

The two organizations proved that the VPN providers fall under the EU Digital Services Regulation, and therefore have a duty to help prevent copyright infringement carried out through their infrastructure.

“The orders identify how VPN systems prove to be a suitable means, 'highly effective and accessible to generate the possibility of access to content not accessible in certain geographic points,' distorting the real geographic location of online access, and facilitating 'access to websites that broadcast protected content illegally,'” reads LaLiga’s announcement.

“What is more, the orders highlight how the defendant companies acknowledge and even advertise that their system is excellent at evading restrictions.”

LaLiga characterized the ruling as unprecedented in Spain, aligning it with similar decisions in France, and celebrated that the liability of VPN providers for piracy is clearly recognized.

In response, ProtonVPN took to Twitter to question the decision, declaring a total lack of awareness of the proceedings and stating that they have not been formally notified.

“Any judicial order issued without proper notification to the affected parties, thereby denying them the opportunity to be heard, would be procedurally invalid under fundamental principles of due process, stated the VPN service provider.

“Spanish courts, like all courts operating under the rule of law, are bound by procedural safeguards that ensure parties are given a fair opportunity to present their case before any binding judgment is rendered.”

In a request for comments to BleepingComputer, NordVPN's spokesperson Laura Tyrylyte stated that the company was not involved in any legal proceedings in Spain.

"At this stage, we have not received the judicial documents mentioned in the press so it will be premature to comment without having reviewed them. We were not part of any Spanish judicial proceedings to our knowledge, and therefore had no opportunity to defend ourselves. Given such judgments impact on how the Internet operates, such an approach by rightsholders is unacceptable" - NordVPN

Tyrylyte stated that the process for blocking domains is ineffective in the fight against piracy as it does not address the root cause. Instead, hosting providers should be the target, since pirates can use subdomains to bypass the restrictions.

"Effective piracy control should focus on eliminating the source of the content, targeting hosting providers, cutting off financing for illegal operations, and increasing the availability of legitimate content."

Through its representative, NordVPN said that the measures affect mostly reputable, paid VPN providers, while free services continue to operate largely unhindered.

"Free VPNs are often harder to regulate and, since users who seek to avoid paying for content are unlikely to pay for a VPN either, these services remain a loophole for pirates to bypass restrictions."

[6] BleepingComputer - Flaws in popular VSCode extensions expose developers to attacks
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 17 Feb 2026 16:27:12 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/flaws-in-popular-vscode-extensions-expose-developers-to-attacks/

[TAM METİN - 492 kelime]
Vulnerabilities with high to critical severity ratings affecting popular Visual Studio Code (VSCode) extensions collectively downloaded more than 128 million times could be exploited to steal local files and execute code remotely.

The security issues impact Code Runner (CVE-2025-65715), Markdown Preview Enhanced (CVE-2025-65716), Markdown Preview Enhanced (CVE-2025-65717), and Microsoft Live Preview (no identifier assigned).

Researchers at application security company Ox Security discovered the flaws and tried to disclose them since June 2025. However, the researchers say that no maintainer responded.

Remote code execution in IDE

VSCode extensions are add-ons that expand the functionality of Microsoft's integrated development environment (IDE). They can add language support, debugging tools, themes, and other functionality or customization options.

They run with significant access to the local development environment, including files, terminals, and network resources.

Ox Security published reports for each of the discovered flaws and warned that keeping the vulnerable extensions could expose the corporate environment to lateral movement, data exfiltration, and system takeover.

An attacker exploiting the CVE-2025-65717 critical vulnerability in the Live Server extension (over 72 million downloads on VSCode) can steal local files by directing the target to a malicious webpage.

The CVE-2025-65715 vulnerability in the Code Runner VSCode extension, with 37 million downloads, allows remote code execution by changing the extension's configuration file. This could be achieved through tricking the target into pasting or applying a maliciously configuration snippet in the global settings.json file.

Rated with a high-severity score of 8.8, CVE-2025-65716 affects the Markdown Preview Enhanced (8.5 million downloads) and can be leveraged to execute JavaScript via maliciously crafted Markdown file.

Ox Security researchers discovered a one-click XSS vulnerability in versions of Microsoft Live Preview before 0.4.16. It can be exploited to access sensitive files on a developer's machine. The extension has more than 11 million downloads on VSCode.

The flaws in the extensions also apply to Cursor and Windsurf, which are AI-powered VSCode-compatible alternative IDEs.

Ox Security's report highlights that the risks associated with a threat actor leveraging the issues include pivoting on the network and stealing sensitive details like API keys and configuration files.

Developers are advised to avoid running localhost servers unless necessary, opening untrusted HTML while they’re running, and applying untrusted configurations or pasting snippets into settings.json.

Also, it is advisable to remove unnecessary extensions and only install those from reputable publishers, while monitoring for unexpected setting changes.

[7] BleepingComputer - Chinese hackers exploiting Dell zero-day flaw since mid-2024
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 17 Feb 2026 15:15:03 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-hackers-exploiting-dell-zero-day-flaw-since-mid-2024/

[TAM METİN - 548 kelime]
A suspected Chinese state-backed hacking group has been quietly exploiting a critical Dell security flaw in zero-day attacks that started in mid-2024.

Security researchers from Mandiant and the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) revealed today that the UNC6201 group exploited a maximum-severity hardcoded-credential vulnerability (tracked as CVE-2026-22769) in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines, a solution used for VMware virtual machine backup and recovery.

"Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines, versions prior to 6.0.3.1 HF1, contain a hardcoded credential vulnerability," Dell explains in a security advisory published on Tuesday.

"This is considered critical as an unauthenticated remote attacker with knowledge of the hardcoded credential could potentially exploit this vulnerability leading to unauthorized access to the underlying operating system and root-level persistence. Dell recommends that customers upgrade or apply one of the remediations as soon as possible."

Once inside a victim's network, UNC6201 deployed several malware payloads, including newly identified backdoor malware called Grimbolt. Written in C# and built using a relatively new compilation technique, this malware is designed to be faster and harder to analyze than its predecessor, a backdoor called Brickstorm.

While the researchers have observed the group swapping out Brickstorm for Grimbolt in September 2025, it remains unclear whether the switch was a planned upgrade or "a reaction to incident response efforts led by Mandiant and other industry partners."

Targeting VMware ESXi servers

The attackers also used novel techniques to burrow deeper into victims' virtualized infrastructure, including creating hidden network interfaces (so-called Ghost NICs) on VMware ESXi servers to move stealthily across victims' networks.

"UNC6201 uses temporary virtual network ports (AKA "Ghost NICs") to pivot from compromised VMs into internal or SaaS environments, a new technique that Mandiant has not observed before in their investigations," Mandiant communications manager Mark Karayan told BleepingComputer.

"Consistent with the earlier BRICKSTORM campaign, UNC6201 continues to target appliances that typically lack traditional endpoint detection and response (EDR) agents to remain undetected for long periods."

The researchers have found overlaps between UNC6201 and a separate Chinese threat cluster, UNC5221, known for exploiting Ivanti zero-days to target government agencies with custom Spawnant and Zipline malware and previously linked to the notorious Silk Typhoon Chinese state-backed threat group (although the two are not considered identical by GTIG).

GTIG added in September that UNC5221 hackers used Brickstorm (first documented by Google subsidiary Mandiant in April 2024) to gain long-term persistence on the networks of multiple U.S. organizations in the legal and technology sectors, while CrowdStrike has linked Brickstorm malware attacks targeting VMware vCenter servers of legal, technology, and manufacturing companies in the United States to a Chinese hacking group it tracks as Warp Panda.

To block ongoing CVE-2026-22769 attacks, Dell customers are advised to follow the remediation guidance shared in this security advisory.

[8] BleepingComputer - Notepad++ boosts update security with ‘double-lock’ mechanism
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 17 Feb 2026 13:29:18 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/notepad-plus-plus-boosts-update-security-with-double-lock-mechanism/

[TAM METİN - 417 kelime]
Notepad++ has adopted a “double-lock” design for its update mechanism to address recently exploited security gaps that resulted in a supply-chain compromise.

The new mechanism landed in Notepad++ version 8.9.2, announced yesterday, although work on it began in version 8.8.9 with implementing the verification of the signed installer from GitHub.

The second part of the double-lock system is checking the signed XML from the notepad-plus-plus.org domain. In practice, this means that the XML file returned from the update service is digitally signed (XMLDSig).

The combination of the two verification mechanisms adds to a more robust "and effectively unexploitable" update process, says the team behind the massively popular open-source text and source code editor.

Additional security-oriented changes applied to the auto-updater include:

Removal of libcurl.dll to eliminate DLL side-loading risk

Removal of two unsecured cURL SSL options: CURLSSLOPT_ALLOW_BEAST and CURLSSLOPT_NO_REVOKE

Restriction of plugin management execution to programs signed with the same certificate as WinGUp

The new announcement also notes that users can exclude the auto-updater during UI installation or deploy the MSI package with: msiexec /i npp.8.9.2.Installer.x64.msi NOUPDATER=1

Earlier this month, Notepad++  and Rapid7 researchers disclosed that the update infrastructure was compromised in a six-month-long campaign attributed to Lotus Blossom, a threat group linked to China.

Starting in June 2025, the bad actor compromised the hosting provider that ran the Notepad++ updater and selectively redirected update requests from specific users to malicious servers.

The attacks exploited weak update verification controls used in older versions of the software, and continued until their discovery on December 2, 2025.

Rapid7’s analysis revealed that the Chinese hackers used a custom backdoor called “Chrysalis” as part of the attack chain.

Apart from the newly introduced security measures, the project immediately switched to a different hosting provider, rotated credentials, and fixed flaws exploited in the discovered attacks.

The recommended action for all Notepad++ users is to upgrade to version 8.9.2, and ensure that installers are always downloaded from the official domain, notepad-plus-plus.org.

[9] Krebs on Security - Kimwolf Botnet Swamps Anonymity Network I2P
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 831 kelime]
For the past week, the massive “Internet of Things” (IoT) botnet known as Kimwolf has been disrupting The Invisible Internet Project (I2P), a decentralized, encrypted communications network designed to anonymize and secure online communications. I2P users started reporting disruptions in the network around the same time the Kimwolf botmasters began relying on it to evade takedown attempts against the botnet’s control servers.

Kimwolf is a botnet that surfaced in late 2025 and quickly infected millions of systems, turning poorly secured IoT devices like TV streaming boxes, digital picture frames and routers into relays for malicious traffic and abnormally large distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

I2P is a decentralized, privacy-focused network that allows people to communicate and share information anonymously.

“It works by routing data through multiple encrypted layers across volunteer-operated nodes, hiding both the sender’s and receiver’s locations,” the I2P website explains. “The result is a secure, censorship-resistant network designed for private websites, messaging, and data sharing.”

On February 3, I2P users began complaining on the organization’s GitHub page about tens of thousands of routers suddenly overwhelming the network, preventing existing users from communicating with legitimate nodes. Users reported a rapidly increasing number of new routers joining the network that were unable to transmit data, and that the mass influx of new systems had overwhelmed the network to the point where users could no longer connect.

I2P users complaining about service disruptions from a rapidly increasing number of routers suddenly swamping the network.

When one I2P user asked whether the network was under attack, another user replied, “Looks like it. My physical router freezes when the number of connections exceeds 60,000.”

A graph shared by I2P developers showing a marked drop in successful connections on the I2P network around the time the Kimwolf botnet started trying to use the network for fallback communications.

The same day that I2P users began noticing the outages, the individuals in control of Kimwolf posted to their Discord channel that they had accidentally disrupted I2P after attempting to join 700,000 Kimwolf-infected bots as nodes on the network.

The Kimwolf botmaster openly discusses what they are doing with the botnet in a Discord channel with my name on it.

Although Kimwolf is known as a potent weapon for launching DDoS attacks, the outages caused this week by some portion of the botnet attempting to join I2P are what’s known as a “Sybil attack,” a threat in peer-to-peer networks where a single entity can disrupt the system by creating, controlling, and operating a large number of fake, pseudonymous identities.

Indeed, the number of Kimwolf-infected routers that tried to join I2P this past week was many times the network’s normal size. I2P’s Wikipedia page says the network consists of roughly 55,000 computers distributed throughout the world, with each participant acting as both a router (to relay traffic) and a client.

However, Lance James, founder of the New York City based cybersecurity consultancy Unit 221B and the original founder of I2P, told KrebsOnSecurity the entire I2P network now consists of between 15,000 and 20,000 devices on any given day.

An I2P user posted this graph on Feb. 10, showing tens of thousands of routers — mostly from the United States — suddenly attempting to join the network.

Benjamin Brundage is founder of Synthient, a startup that tracks proxy services and was the first to document Kimwolf’s unique spreading techniques. Brundage said the Kimwolf operator(s) have been trying to build a command and control network that can’t easily be taken down by security companies and network operators that are working together to combat the spread of the botnet.

Brundage said the people in control of Kimwolf have been experimenting with using I2P and a similar anonymity network — Tor — as a backup command and control network, although there have been no reports of widespread disruptions in the Tor network recently.

“I don’t think their goal is to take I2P down,” he said. “It’s more they’re looking for an alternative to keep the botnet stable in the face of takedown attempts.”

The Kimwolf botnet created challenges for Cloudflare late last year when it began instructing millions of infected devices to use Cloudflare’s domain name system (DNS) settings, causing control domains associated with Kimwolf to repeatedly usurp Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft in Cloudflare’s public ranking of the most frequently requested websites.

James said the I2P network is still operating at about half of its normal capacity, and that a new release is rolling out which should bring some stability improvements over the next week for users.

Meanwhile, Brundage said the good news is Kimwolf’s overlords appear to have quite recently alienated some of their more competent developers and operators, leading to a rookie mistake this past week that caused the botnet’s overall numbers to drop by more than 600,000 infected systems.

“It seems like they’re just testing stuff, like running experiments in production,” he said. “But the botnet’s numbers are dropping significantly now, and they don’t seem to know what they’re doing.”

[10] Krebs on Security - Please Don’t Feed the Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters

[TAM METİN - 1200 kelime]
A prolific data ransom gang that calls itself Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters (SLSH) has a distinctive playbook when it seeks to extort payment from victim firms: Harassing, threatening and even swatting executives and their families, all while notifying journalists and regulators about the extent of the intrusion. Some victims reportedly are paying — perhaps as much to contain the stolen data as to stop the escalating personal attacks. But a top SLSH expert warns that engaging at all beyond a “We’re not paying” response only encourages further harassment, noting that the group’s fractious and unreliable history means the only winning move is not to pay.

Unlike traditional, highly regimented Russia-based ransomware affiliate groups, SLSH is an unruly and somewhat fluid English-language extortion gang that appears uninterested in building a reputation of consistent behavior whereby victims might have some measure of confidence that the criminals will keep their word if paid.

That’s according to Allison Nixon, director of research at the New York City based security consultancy Unit 221B. Nixon has been closely tracking the criminal group and individual members as they bounce between various Telegram channels used to extort and harass victims, and she said SLSH differs from traditional data ransom groups in other important ways that argue against trusting them to do anything they say they’ll do — such as destroying stolen data.

Like SLSH, many traditional Russian ransomware groups have employed high-pressure tactics to force payment in exchange for a decryption key and/or a promise to delete stolen data, such as publishing a dark web shaming blog with samples of stolen data next to a countdown clock, or notifying journalists and board members of the victim company. But Nixon said the extortion from SLSH quickly escalates way beyond that — to threats of physical violence against executives and their families, DDoS attacks on the victim’s website, and repeated email-flooding campaigns.

SLSH is known for breaking into companies by phishing employees over the phone, and using the purloined access to steal sensitive internal data. In a January 30 blog post, Google’s security forensics firm Mandiant said SLSH’s most recent extortion attacks stem from incidents spanning early to mid-January 2026, when SLSH members pretended to be IT staff and called employees at targeted victim organizations claiming that the company was updating MFA settings.

“The threat actor directed the employees to victim-branded credential harvesting sites to capture their SSO credentials and MFA codes, and then registered their own device for MFA,” the blog post explained.

Victims often first learn of the breach when their brand name is uttered on whatever ephemeral new public Telegram group chat SLSH is using to threaten, extort and harass their prey. According to Nixon, the coordinated harassment on the SLSH Telegram channels is part of a well-orchestrated strategy to overwhelm the victim organization by manufacturing humiliation that pushes them over the threshold to pay.

Nixon said multiple executives at targeted organizations have been subject to “swatting” attacks, wherein SLSH communicated a phony bomb threat or hostage situation at the target’s address in the hopes of eliciting a heavily armed police response at their home or place of work.

“A big part of what they’re doing to victims is the psychological aspect of it, like harassing executives’ kids and threatening the board of the company,” Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. “And while these victims are getting extortion demands, they’re simultaneously getting outreach from media outlets saying, ‘Hey, do you have any comments on the bad things we’re going to write about you.”

In a blog post today, Unit 221B argues that no one should negotiate with SLSH because the group has demonstrated a willingness to extort victims based on promises that it has no intention to keep. Nixon points out that all of SLSH’s known members hail from The Com, shorthand for a constellation of cybercrime-focused Discord and Telegram communities which serve as a kind of distributed social network that facilitates instant collaboration.

Nixon said Com-based extortion groups tend to instigate feuds and drama between group members, leading to lying, betrayals, credibility destroying behavior, backstabbing, and sabotaging each other.

“With this type of ongoing dysfunction, often compounding by substance abuse, these threat actors often aren’t able to act with the core goal in mind of completing a successful, strategic ransom operation,” Nixon wrote. “They continually lose control with outbursts that put their strategy and operational security at risk, which severely limits their ability to build a professional, scalable, and sophisticated criminal organization network for continued successful ransoms – unlike other, more tenured and professional criminal organizations focused on ransomware alone.”

Intrusions from established ransomware groups typically center around encryption/decryption malware that mostly stays on the affected machine. In contrast, Nixon said, ransom from a Com group is often structured the same as violent sextortion schemes against minors, wherein members of The Com will steal damaging information, threaten to release it, and “promise” to delete it if the victim complies without any guarantee or technical proof point that they will keep their word. She writes:

A key component of SLSH’s efforts to convince victims to pay, Nixon said, involves manipulating the media into hyping the threat posed by this group. This approach also borrows a page from the playbook of sextortion attacks, she said, which encourages predators to keep targets continuously engaged and worrying about the consequences of non-compliance.

“On days where SLSH had no substantial criminal ‘win’ to announce, they focused on announcing death threats and harassment to keep law enforcement, journalists, and cybercrime industry professionals focused on this group,” she said.

Nixon knows a thing or two about being threatened by SLSH: For the past several months, the group’s Telegram channels have been replete with threats of physical violence against her, against Yours Truly, and against other security researchers. These threats, she said, are just another way the group seeks to generate media attention and achieve a veneer of credibility, but they are useful as indicators of compromise because SLSH members tend to name drop and malign security researchers even in their communications with victims.

“Watch for the following behaviors in their communications to you or their public statements,” Unit 221B’s advisory reads. “Repeated abusive mentions of Allison Nixon (or “A.N”), Unit 221B, or cybersecurity journalists—especially Brian Krebs—or any other cybersecurity employee, or cybersecurity company. Any threats to kill, or commit terrorism, or violence against internal employees, cybersecurity employees, investigators, and journalists.”

Unit 221B says that while the pressure campaign during an extortion attempt may be traumatizing to employees, executives, and their family members, entering into drawn-out negotiations with SLSH incentivizes the group to increase the level of harm and risk, which could include the physical safety of employees and their families.

“The breached data will never go back to the way it was, but we can assure you that the harassment will end,” Nixon said. “So, your decision to pay should be a separate issue from the harassment. We believe that when you separate these issues, you will objectively see that the best course of action to protect your interests, in both the short and long term, is to refuse payment.”

[11] Krebs on Security - Who Operates the Badbox 2.0 Botnet?
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Mon, 26 Jan 2026 16:11:38 +0000
Link: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/01/who-operates-the-badbox-2-0-botnet/

[TAM METİN - 1452 kelime]
The cybercriminals in control of Kimwolf — a disruptive botnet that has infected more than 2 million devices — recently shared a screenshot indicating they’d compromised the control panel for Badbox 2.0, a vast China-based botnet powered by malicious software that comes pre-installed on many Android TV streaming boxes. Both the FBI and Google say they are hunting for the people behind Badbox 2.0, and thanks to bragging by the Kimwolf botmasters we may now have a much clearer idea about that.

Our first story of 2026, The Kimwolf Botnet is Stalking Your Local Network, detailed the unique and highly invasive methods Kimwolf uses to spread. The story warned that the vast majority of Kimwolf infected systems were unofficial Android TV boxes that are typically marketed as a way to watch unlimited (pirated) movie and TV streaming services for a one-time fee.

Our January 8 story, Who Benefitted from the Aisuru and Kimwolf Botnets?, cited multiple sources saying the current administrators of Kimwolf went by the nicknames “Dort” and “Snow.” Earlier this month, a close former associate of Dort and Snow shared what they said was a screenshot the Kimwolf botmasters had taken while logged in to the Badbox 2.0 botnet control panel.

That screenshot, a portion of which is shown below, shows seven authorized users of the control panel, including one that doesn’t quite match the others: According to my source, the account “ABCD” (the one that is logged in and listed in the top right of the screenshot) belongs to Dort, who somehow figured out how to add their email address as a valid user of the Badbox 2.0 botnet.

The control panel for the Badbox 2.0 botnet lists seven authorized users and their email addresses. Click to enlarge.

Badbox has a storied history that well predates Kimwolf’s rise in October 2025. In July 2025, Google filed a “John Doe” lawsuit (PDF) against 25 unidentified defendants accused of operating Badbox 2.0, which Google described as a botnet of over ten million unsanctioned Android streaming devices engaged in advertising fraud. Google said Badbox 2.0, in addition to compromising multiple types of devices prior to purchase, also can infect devices by requiring the download of malicious apps from unofficial marketplaces.

Google’s lawsuit came on the heels of a June 2025 advisory from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which warned that cyber criminals were gaining unauthorized access to home networks by either configuring the products with malware prior to the user’s purchase, or infecting the device as it downloads required applications that contain backdoors — usually during the set-up process.

The FBI said Badbox 2.0 was discovered after the original Badbox campaign was disrupted in 2024. The original Badbox was identified in 2023, and primarily consisted of Android operating system devices (TV boxes) that were compromised with backdoor malware prior to purchase.

KrebsOnSecurity was initially skeptical of the claim that the Kimwolf botmasters had hacked the Badbox 2.0 botnet. That is, until we began digging into the history of the qq.com email addresses in the screenshot above.

An online search for the address 34557257@qq.com (pictured in the screenshot above as the user “Chen“) shows it is listed as a point of contact for a number of China-based technology companies, including:

–Beijing Hong Dake Wang Science & Technology Co Ltd.
–Beijing Hengchuang Vision Mobile Media Technology Co. Ltd.
–Moxin Beijing Science and Technology Co. Ltd.

The website for Beijing Hong Dake Wang Science is asmeisvip[.]net, a domain that was flagged in a March 2025 report by HUMAN Security as one of several dozen sites tied to the distribution and management of the Badbox 2.0 botnet. Ditto for moyix[.]com, a domain associated with Beijing Hengchuang Vision Mobile.

A search at the breach tracking service Constella Intelligence finds 34557257@qq.com at one point used the password “cdh76111.” Pivoting on that password in Constella shows it is known to have been used by just two other email accounts: daihaic@gmail.com and cathead@gmail.com.

Constella found cathead@gmail.com registered an account at jd.com (China’s largest online retailer) in 2021 under the name “陈代海,” which translates to “Chen Daihai.” According to DomainTools.com, the name Chen Daihai is present in the original registration records (2008) for moyix[.]com, along with the email address cathead@astrolink[.]cn.

Incidentally, astrolink[.]cn also is among the Badbox 2.0 domains identified in HUMAN Security’s 2025 report. DomainTools finds cathead@astrolink[.]cn was used to register more than a dozen domains, including vmud[.]net, yet another Badbox 2.0 domain tagged by HUMAN Security.

A cached copy of astrolink[.]cn preserved at archive.org shows the website belongs to a mobile app development company whose full name is Beijing Astrolink Wireless Digital Technology Co. Ltd. The archived website reveals a “Contact Us” page that lists a Chen Daihai as part of the company’s technology department. The other person featured on that contact page is Zhu Zhiyu, and their email address is listed as xavier@astrolink[.]cn.

A Google-translated version of Astrolink’s website, circa 2009. Image: archive.org.

Astute readers will notice that the user Mr.Zhu in the Badbox 2.0 panel used the email address xavierzhu@qq.com. Searching this address in Constella reveals a jd.com account registered in the name of Zhu Zhiyu. A rather unique password used by this account matches the password used by the address xavierzhu@gmail.com, which DomainTools finds was the original registrant of astrolink[.]cn.

The very first account listed in the Badbox 2.0 panel — “admin,” registered in November 2020 — used the email address 189308024@qq.com. DomainTools shows this email is found in the 2022 registration records for the domain guilincloud[.]cn, which includes the registrant name “Huang Guilin.”

Constella finds 189308024@qq.com is associated with the China phone number 18681627767. The open-source intelligence platform osint.industries reveals this phone number is connected to a Microsoft profile created in 2014 under the name Guilin Huang (桂林 黄). The cyber intelligence platform Spycloud says that phone number was used in 2017 to create an account at the Chinese social media platform Weibo under the username “h_guilin.”

The public information attached to Guilin Huang’s Microsoft account, according to the breach tracking service osintindustries.com.

The remaining three users and corresponding qq.com email addresses were all connected to individuals in China. However, none of them (nor Mr. Huang) had any apparent connection to the entities created and operated by Chen Daihai and Zhu Zhiyu — or to any corporate entities for that matter. Also, none of these individuals responded to requests for comment.

The mind map below includes search pivots on the email addresses, company names and phone numbers that suggest a connection between Chen Daihai, Zhu Zhiyu, and Badbox 2.0.

This mind map includes search pivots on the email addresses, company names and phone numbers that appear to connect Chen Daihai and Zhu Zhiyu to Badbox 2.0. Click to enlarge.

The idea that the Kimwolf botmasters could have direct access to the Badbox 2.0 botnet is a big deal, but explaining exactly why that is requires some background on how Kimwolf spreads to new devices. The botmasters figured out they could trick residential proxy services into relaying malicious commands to vulnerable devices behind the firewall on the unsuspecting user’s local network.

The vulnerable systems sought out by Kimwolf are primarily Internet of Things (IoT) devices like unsanctioned Android TV boxes and digital photo frames that have no discernible security or authentication built-in. Put simply, if you can communicate with these devices, you can compromise them with a single command.

Our January 2 story featured research from the proxy-tracking firm Synthient, which alerted 11 different residential proxy providers that their proxy endpoints were vulnerable to being abused for this kind of local network probing and exploitation.

Most of those vulnerable proxy providers have since taken steps to prevent customers from going upstream into the local networks of residential proxy endpoints, and it appeared that Kimwolf would no longer be able to quickly spread to millions of devices simply by exploiting some residential proxy provider.

However, the source of that Badbox 2.0 screenshot said the Kimwolf botmasters had an ace up their sleeve the whole time: Secret access to the Badbox 2.0 botnet control panel.

“Dort has gotten unauthorized access,” the source said. “So, what happened is normal proxy providers patched this. But Badbox doesn’t sell proxies by itself, so it’s not patched. And as long as Dort has access to Badbox, they would be able to load” the Kimwolf malware directly onto TV boxes associated with Badbox 2.0.

The source said it isn’t clear how Dort gained access to the Badbox botnet panel. But it’s unlikely that Dort’s existing account will persist for much longer: All of our notifications to the qq.com email addresses listed in the control panel screenshot received a copy of that image, as well as questions about the apparently rogue ABCD account.

[12] Security Affairs - Keenadu backdoor found preinstalled on Android devices, powers Ad fraud campaign
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 18 Feb 2026 08:31:02 +0000
Link: https://securityaffairs.com/188147/malware/keenadu-backdoor-found-preinstalled-on-android-devices-powers-ad-fraud-campaign.html

[TAM METİN - 737 kelime]
Kaspersky has identified a new Android malware called Keenadu. It can be preinstalled in device firmware, hidden inside system apps, or even distributed via official stores like Google Play. Currently used for ad fraud by turning infected phones into click bots, some variants also allow attackers to gain full remote control of compromised devices.

After uncovering the Triada backdoor in counterfeit Android firmware, researchers found another firmware-level threat called Keenadu. Like Triada, Keenadu embeds itself into the system during the build process, injects into the Zygote process, and infects every app launched on the device. It acts as a multi-stage loader, enabling full remote control, ad fraud, credential theft, and malicious payload delivery.

The researchers reported that some infected firmware was even pushed via OTA updates and built into core system apps. Investigators also linked Keenadu to major Android botnets, including Triada, BADBOX, and Vo1d.

Researchers found that Keenadu was embedded inside Android’s core library, libandroid_runtime.so, acting as a hidden dropper. A modified logging function decrypted an RC4-encrypted payload and loaded it into every app via the Zygote process. The malicious code uses a client-server setup called AKClient and AKServer.

“We discovered a new backdoor, which we dubbed Keenadu, in the firmware of devices belonging to several brands. The infection occurred during the firmware build phase, where a malicious static library was linked with libandroid_runtime.so. Once active on the device, the malware injected itself into the Zygote process, similarly to Triada. In several instances, the compromised firmware was delivered with an OTA update.” reads the report published by Kaspersky. “A copy of the backdoor is loaded into the address space of every app upon launch. The malware is a multi-stage loader granting its operators the unrestricted ability to control the victim’s device remotely.”

This design lets the attackers bypass Android permissions, give apps special privileges, steal data, install extra plugins, and connect to encrypted command-and-control servers. The malware also avoids infecting devices set to the Chinese language or devices that do not have Google services installed.

The researchers discovered that the backdoor was preinstalled in the firmware for Alldocube tablets. The malicious code traced to a rogue static library added during the build process. Attackers used valid digital signatures, a circumstance that suggests this was a supply chain compromise, likely introduced before devices reached the market, and affecting multiple vendors.

Keenadu’s backdoor gives attackers near-total control of infected Android devices and loads extra malicious modules from its C2 server. To avoid detection, the server waits about 2.5 months after activation before delivering payloads. The modules are downloaded from Amazon AWS, verified with MD5 and DSA signatures, then decrypted and executed.

Kaspersky identified multiple plugins: a loader targeting Amazon, SHEIN and Temu apps that can install hidden APKs; clicker modules injected into apps like YouTube, Facebook and system components to generate ad fraud; a Chrome module that steals search queries and hijacks results; and “Nova,” a clicker using advanced techniques to interact with ads.

Other modules monetize app installs, collect device data, retrieve advertising IDs, and may deploy spyware or additional droppers. Some victims reported tablets adding shopping cart items without their knowledge.

Researchers found Keenadu spreading beyond the original firmware compromise. The loader was embedded inside legitimate system apps, including a facial recognition service, launchers, and content center apps, where it was triggered by normal system events. Some variants relied on a native library to load modules and silently install APKs.

Other samples were deployed through a separate backdoor linked to BADBOX, suggesting cooperation between malware platforms. Keenadu was also distributed via modified popular apps from unofficial stores and even Google Play, where trojanized smart camera apps with over 300,000 downloads secretly launched the Nova clicker under specific conditions.

As of February 2026, Kaspersky detected more than 13,000 Android devices infected with Keenadu. Most victims were located in Russia, Japan, Germany, Brazil, and the Netherlands, although infections were reported in other countries as well.

” During the investigation, we were surprised by the scope of the Keenadu campaigns: beyond the primary backdoor in firmware, its modules were found in system apps and even in apps from Google Play.” concludes the report. “This places the Trojan on the same scale as threats like Triada or BADBOX. The emergence of a new pre-installed backdoor of this magnitude indicates that this category of malware is a distinct market with significant competition.”

[13] Security Affairs - SmartLoader hackers clone Oura MCP project to spread StealC malware
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 546 kelime]
Straiker’s AI Research (STAR) Labs team uncovered a SmartLoader campaign in which attackers cloned a legitimate MCP server linked to Oura Health to spread the StealC information stealer. The fake project appeared credible, complete with bogus forks and contributors, to trick users into downloading a trojanized version. Once installed, it deployed malware designed to steal sensitive data.

“Our investigation revealed the threat actors cloned a legitimate Oura MCP Server—a tool that connects AI assistants to Oura Ring health data—and built a deceptive infrastructure of fake forks and contributors to manufacture credibility. The trojanized version of the Oura MCP server delivers the StealC infostealer, targeting developer credentials, browser passwords, and cryptocurrency wallets.” reads the report published by Straiker. “This campaign signals a significant shift in the threat landscape: traditional threat actors who have long targeted software supply chains are now pivoting to MCP ecosystems, bringing their proven tactics and operational sophistication to this emerging attack surface.”

Researchers say the SmartLoader operators spent months building a fake GitHub ecosystem to make their malware look trustworthy. They first chose a popular developer tool: the Oura MCP Server, a project created by an OpenAI engineer that connects AI assistants to Oura Ring data. The target was attractive because productivity-focused developers are likely to hold valuable credentials.

Next, the attackers created a network of fake GitHub accounts, forking the legitimate project to simulate real community interest. The main account, YuzeHao2023, created the initial clean fork:

Four additional accounts then forked the same project to make it appear popular and legitimate:

“These accounts exhibit characteristics consistent with AI-generated personas: recent creation dates, similar activity patterns, and commits concentrated in the same timeframe. The fake accounts also forked other projects from YuzeHao2023, creating a web of cross-references designed to make each account appear more established.” continues the report. “Any organization deploying MCP-enabled AI tools is vulnerable to supply chain compromise”

The researchers believe the accounts were AI-generated and cross-linked each other’s activity to appear established.

Once credibility was built, they launched a separate repository containing a trojanized version, deliberately excluding the original author to avoid scrutiny.

Finally, they submitted the malicious package to public MCP registries, so developers searching for Oura integrations would unknowingly download the infected version.

SmartLoader, a malware group known for spreading info-stealers through fake installers, has shifted tactics from targeting piracy users to compromising developers via the supply chain. The malware used LuaJIT, heavy virtual machine obfuscation, scheduled tasks disguised as Realtek drivers, and ultimately deployed StealC to steal passwords, crypto wallets, API keys, and cloud credentials. The infrastructure and techniques match known SmartLoader patterns, with indicators pointing to China-based operations. Security experts warn that developer environments are now prime targets and urge stronger vetting of AI tooling and MCP servers.

“SmartLoader’s campaign against the MCP ecosystem should serve as a wake-up call for security leaders. Threat actors have moved beyond opportunistic malware distribution and they are now investing in elaborate social engineering infrastructure to compromise developer supply chains.” concludes the report. “As AI assistants become integral to enterprise workflows, the MCP servers that extend their capabilities become a critical attack surface. Organizations that fail to secure this vector expose themselves to credential theft, data exfiltration, and supply chain compromise.”

Tracking Malware Campaigns With Reused Material

A few days ago I wrote a diary called "Malicious Script Delivering More Maliciousness"[1]. In the malware infection chain, there was a JPEG picture that embedded the last payload delimited with "BaseStart-" and "-BaseEnd" tags.

Today, I discovered anoher campaign that relies exactly on the same technique. It started with an attachment called "TELERADIO_IB_OBYEKTLRIN_BURAXILIS_FORMASI.xIs" (SHA256:1bf3ec53ddd7399cdc1faf1f0796c5228adc438b6b7fa2513399cdc0cb865962). The file in itself is not interesting, it contains a good old Equation Editor exploit (CVE-2017-11882). The exploit triggers the download of an HTA payload that executes a PowerShell payload and finally a DLL:

When I investigated the different payload, there was pretty simple to deobfuscated, the interesting code was polluted with Unicode characters. First the HTA file was downloaded from:

The interesting code is here and you can easily spot the "powershell" string, no need to use AI for this :-)

The Powershell payload will fetch another file:

Do you make the link with my previous diary? It's the same picture:

[15] Cyberscoop - Chinese hackers exploited a Dell zero-day for 18 months before anyone noticed
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 18 Feb 2026 00:32:44 +0000

[TAM METİN - 771 kelime]
Researchers uncovered more worrying details about a long-running cyber espionage campaign suspected to be backed by the Chinese government, exemplifying how such attacks often go undetected until they’ve already caused significant damage.

Google Threat Intelligence Group and Mandiant said the Chinese threat group UNC6201 has been exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines since at least mid-2024. The group overlaps with UNC5221, also known as Silk Typhoon, which has been burrowing into critical infrastructure and government agency networks undetected since at least 2022.

The zero-day exploitation marks an escalation from this particular cluster of actors.  State-sponsored attackers spent years implanting Brickstorm malware into networks before the campaign was finally detected last summer. By September, however, the attackers had replaced Brickstorm with Grimbolt, a more advanced malware that’s harder to detect, Google security researchers said Tuesday.

The zero-day vulnerability — CVE-2026-22769 — hinges on a hardcoded administrator password in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines that was pulled from Apache Tomcat. It carries a 10/10 CVSS rating. The Chinese threat group has been using the hardcoded password, which triggers the vulnerability and allows unauthenticated remote attackers to gain full system access with root-level persistence for at least 18 months, Google said.

Dell Technologies disclosed and released a patch for the vulnerability Tuesday. A company spokesperson urged customers to follow guidance in its security advisory.

“We are aware of less than a dozen impacted organizations, but because the full scale of this campaign is unknown we recommend that organizations previously targeted by Brickstorm look out for Grimbolt in their environments,” Austin Larsen, principal analyst at GTIG, told CyberScoop.

When the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency unveiled new details about the campaign in December, Google said dozens of U.S. organizations, not including downstream victims, had already been impacted by Brickstorm.

“The actor is likely still active in unpatched and remediated environments, and because exploitation has been occurring since mid-2024, they have had significant time to establish persistence and carry out long-term espionage,” Larsen added.

The campaign — one of many concurrent efforts by China state-sponsored groups to embed themselves into networks for long-term access, disruptions and potential sabotage — remains a top area of concern for national security.

CISA, the National Security Agency and Canadian Centre for Cyber Security released new analysis on Brickstorm last week to share indicators and compromise that could help potential victims detect malicious activity on their networks.

Yet, the China-linked groups involved in this campaign have already moved on to Grimbolt, in some cases replacing older Brickstorm binaries with the new backdoor that’s more difficult to reverse engineer, according to Google.

Marci McCarthy, director of public affairs at CISA, told CyberScoop the agency will share further information on Wednesday.

Google’s fresh research on the China state-sponsored campaign demonstrates how the threat group’s tenacity, and ability to dwell undetected in networks longer than 400 days, keeps defenders and cyber authorities at a disadvantage.

The threat groups typically target edge applications and devices running on systems without endpoint detection and response, but researchers don’t know how attackers broke into the networks of the most recently discovered victims.

Researchers only have a narrow view of the threat groups’ activities at large.

“We suspect a significant portion of UNC5221 and UNC6201’s activity likely remains unknown, and there is a strong probability that they are developing or using undiscovered zero-days and malware,” Larsen said. “The most concerning aspect of this campaign is that additional organizations were likely compromised as part of this campaign and do not know it yet.”

[16] Cyberscoop - Polish authorities arrest alleged Phobos ransomware affiliate

[TAM METİN - 526 kelime]
Polish officials arrested a 47-year-old man accused of participating in ransomware attacks as an affiliate for the Phobos ransomware group, the country’s Central Bureau for Combating Cybercrime said Tuesday.

Authorities did not name the man who was arrested during a raid on his apartment in the Małopolskie province, but said he faces up to five years in prison for his alleged crimes.

The arrest is the latest in a series of coordinated law enforcement actions targeting people involved with Phobos ransomware attacks, which were also carried out by the 8base ransomware group. Polish officials said they identified the suspect through the “Phobos Aetor” operation, a Europol-led effort involving agencies across Europe, Asia and North America that took place in February 2025.

Officials accused the 47-year-old man of possessing credentials, credit card numbers and IP addresses for servers that may have been used to conduct various attacks. He also had tools that could breach servers and used encrypted messaging platforms to communicate with others linked to Phobos, police said.

During the raid, police said they seized a computer and multiple mobile phones that were used to commit cyberattacks. The unnamed suspect was charged with producing, obtaining and sharing computer programs used to illegally obtain information stored on IT systems.

Phobos ransomware had claimed more than 1,000 victims globally and received more than $16 million in extortion payments by February 2025, according to the Justice Department. Victims of Phobos ransomware attacks, which date back to at least November 2020, include hospitals, schools, non-profit organizations, and a company that contracted with the Defense Department, officials said.

Malicious activity linked to Phobos significantly declined when Russian national Evgenii Ptitsyn, the alleged developer and administrator of Phobos ransomware, was extradited from South Korea to the United States in November 2024.

Ptitsyn, also known as “derxan” and “zimmermanx,” was charged with multiple counts of cybercrime, including wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, extortion in relation to hacking and causing intentional damage to protected computers.

Pretrial motions for his case are due this week in the U.S. District Court of Maryland.

[17] Cyberscoop - Palo Alto Networks’ Koi acquisition is all about keeping AI agents in check
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 17 Feb 2026 16:55:47 +0000
Link: https://cyberscoop.com/palo-alto-networks-acquires-koi-agentic-ai-security/

[TAM METİN - 616 kelime]
Palo Alto Networks announced Tuesday its plans to buy security startup Koi, a deal aimed at addressing the security risks emerging as organizations rapidly adopt agentic AI.

Terms were not disclosed, but Israeli business outlet Globes reported that Palo Alto will pay approximately $400 million. The deal is another among a trend of larger cybersecurity industry companies buying AI-focused security startups.

In a statement announcing the agreement, Palo Alto Networks argues that “agentic” tools are reshaping endpoint risk because they can act with broad privileges, interact with multiple systems and move data in ways that older security products were not designed to monitor. For years, endpoint protection emphasized detecting malicious files and stopping known malware techniques. The new concern described in the announcement centers on legitimate software that can become dangerous through compromise, misconfiguration or abuse. AI agents, in this framing, resemble highly capable insiders: they operate using a user’s credentials, can take actions on a user’s behalf and may do so automatically and at speed.

“AI agents and tools are the ultimate insiders,” said Lee Klarich, Palo Alto’s chief product & technology officer. “They have full access to your systems and data, but operate entirely outside the view of traditional security controls. By acquiring Koi, we will be closing this gap and setting a new standard for endpoint security. We will give our customers the visibility and control required to safely harness the power of AI — ensuring that every agent, plugin, and script is governed, verified, and secure.”

Palo Alto Networks says Koi’s technology would be integrated into its Prisma AIRS AI security platform and would enhance the company’s Cortex XDR endpoint product. The stated goal is better visibility into AI-driven activity on endpoints and additional controls over tools that fall outside conventional security monitoring.

Palo Alto Networks and Koi describe their approach moving forward as “Agentic Endpoint Security,” built around visibility into AI-related software, continuous risk analysis and real-time policy enforcement. The language suggests an attempt to define a new product category at a moment when enterprises are still deciding how to govern AI tools that are proliferating through developer workflows and everyday office software.

The proposed acquisition also signals how major security vendors may respond to enterprise AI adoption: by packaging agent governance, monitoring and control into endpoint and cloud security portfolios, and by treating AI-driven automation as a distinct source of risk rather than a feature layered onto existing defenses.

The acquisition is the second AI-focused deal for Palo Alto in the plast six months. In November, the company announced it was acquiring Chronosphere, an AI-focused observability firm, for $3.35 billion.

[18] The Register - China-linked snoops have been exploiting Dell 0-day since mid-2024, using 'ghost NICs' to avoid detection

China-linked snoops have been exploiting Dell 0-day since mid-2024, using 'ghost NICs' to avoid detection

Full scale of infections remains 'unknown'

China-linked attackers exploited a maximum-severity hardcoded-credential bug in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines as a zero-day since at least mid-2024. It's all part of a long-running effort to backdoor infected machines for long-term access, according to Google's Mandiant incident response team.

The US government and Google first warned about this campaign last year after detecting Brickstorm backdoors in dozens of critical US networks.

Dell disclosed and patched the critical flaw (CVE-2026-22769) on Tuesday – but noted that miscreants had found and exploited the bug before it issued a fix.

"We have received a report of limited active exploitation of this vulnerability," a Dell spokesperson told The Register. "Customers are urged to immediately implement one of the remediations detailed" in the advisory.

According to Mandiant and the Google Threat Intelligence Group, which also published a security alert on Tuesday about the Dell zero-day, the suspected PRC-linked intruders exploited CVE-2026-22769 to deploy malware including Brickstorm and a separate backdoor tracked as Grimbolt, and in some cases replaced older Brickstorm binaries with Grimbolt, while also creating “Ghost NICs” on virtual machines to enable stealthy network pivoting.

"Analysis of incident response engagements revealed that UNC6201, a suspected PRC-nexus threat cluster, has exploited this flaw since at least mid-2024 to move laterally, maintain persistent access, and deploy malware including Slaystyle, Brickstorm, and a novel backdoor tracked as Grimbolt," said Google threat hunters Peter Ukhanov, Daniel Sislo, Nick Harbour, John Scarbrough, Fernando Tomlinson, Jr, and Rich Reece.

Because the full scale of this campaign is unknown, we recommend that organizations previously targeted by Brickstorm look out for Grimbolt in their environments

When asked about the scope of exploitation, Mandiant Consulting manager Reece, who co-authored the report, said Mandiant knows of "less than a dozen" organizations affected by CVE-2026-22769. "But because the full scale of this campaign is unknown, we recommend that organizations previously targeted by Brickstorm look out for Grimbolt in their environments," he told The Register.

New and improved backdoor

While the earlier versions of the Brickstorm backdoor were written in Go, and later Rust, it appears the attacker replaced these binaries with Grimbolt in September 2025, according to Mandiant.

Grimbolt, written in C#, uses native ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation to translate programming language code into native machine code before the application runs. It's also packed with UPX, an executable packer that compresses the native binary files produced by AOT.

These features make the malware less likely to raise any flags via static analysis, and enhance performance on resource-constrained appliances.

Grimbolt also provides the same remote shell capability and uses the same command and control infrastructure as the earlier Brickstorm malware.

"UNC6201 established Brickstorm and Grimbolt persistence on the Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines by modifying a legitimate shell script named convert_hosts.sh to include the path to the backdoor," the Googlers reported. "This shell script is executed by the appliance at boot time via rc.local."

Plus, they note, the IR team discovered the Dell zero-day while investigating a victim's environment that had been backdoored by Brickstorm and Grimbolt.

Security analysts spotted "multiple web requests" to vulnerable appliances using the username "admin" and directed to the installed Apache Tomcat Manager.

Google warns China-linked spies lurking in 'numerous' enterprises

PRC spies Brickstormed their way into critical US networks and remained hidden for years

China remains embedded in US energy networks 'for the purpose of taking it down'

Google patches Chrome zero-day as in-the-wild exploits surface

Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines uses Apache Tomcat as its web server, and the security sleuths soon discovered that the attackers had been exploiting a hardcoded password in Apache Tomcat to then deploy a malicious WAR file containing a Slaystyle web shell.

"This is considered critical as an unauthenticated remote attacker with knowledge of the hardcoded credential could potentially exploit this vulnerability leading to unauthorized access to the underlying operating system and root-level persistence."

Additionally, after abusing the bug to exploit the Dell appliances, UNC6201 then created "ghost NICs" – hidden, temporary network ports on existing virtual machines running on an ESXi server – to burrow deeper into victims' VMware virtual infrastructure.

VMware did not immediately respond to The Register's inquiries.

The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and CrowdStrike both previously warned that Chinese attackers were targeting organizations' VMware environments and using Brickstorm for persistent access.

"State-sponsored actors are not just infiltrating networks," CISA's Nick Andersen, executive assistant director for cybersecurity, said in December. "They're embedding themselves to enable long term access, disruption, and potential sabotage." ®

China remains embedded in US energy networks 'for the purpose of taking it down'

Plus 3 new goon squads targeted critical infrastructure last year

Three new threat groups began targeting critical infrastructure last year, while a well-known Beijing-backed crew - Volt Typhoon - continued to compromise cellular gateways and routers, and then break into US electric, oil, and gas companies in 2025, according to Dragos' annual threat report published on Tuesday.

Dragos specializes in operational technology (OT) security, and as such, its customers include energy, water, manufacturing, transportation, and other critical industries. Unsurprisingly, these are key sectors for Chinese, Russian, and other government-linked cyber operatives to hack for espionage and warfare purposes.

In its yearly cybersecurity report, Dragos said state-sponsored crews haven't let up on their attempts to compromise America's critical infrastructure, with three new OT-focused threat groups joining the fray. This brings the total number worldwide to 26, and of these, 11 were active in 2025.

Additionally, an existing group that Dragos tracks as Voltzite and is "highly correlated" with Volt Typhoon, according to Dragos CEO Robert M. Lee, kept up its intrusion activities last year. This is the Beijing goon squad that the US government has accused of burrowing into critical American networks for years and readying destructive cyberattacks against those targets.

In 2025, Voltzite continued embedding its malware inside strategic American utilities "to maintain long-term persistence," Lee said.

"They [Voltzite] weren't just getting in and getting access - they were getting inside the control loop" system that manages utilities' industrial processes, Lee said in a briefing with reporters, adding that the PRC-backed crew's primary focus is causing future disruption.

Voltzite was embedded in that infrastructure for the purpose of taking it down

"Nothing that they were taking was useful for intellectual property," Lee said. "Everything they were doing and learning was only useful for disrupting or causing destruction at those sites. Voltzite was embedded in that infrastructure for the purpose of taking it down."

In one of these campaigns, the intruders compromised Sierra Wireless AirLink devices and used these to access US pipeline operations' OT networks. Dragos observed Voltzite exfiltrating operational and sensor data, and said the level of access the intruders had to the OT networks allowed them to potentially manipulate control systems. They also accessed engineering workstations and stole configuration files and alarm data, which included information about how to force stop operations.

In another Voltzite-linked campaign, Dragos spotted the crew using the JDY botnet to scan for public-facing Internet Protocol (IP) address ranges and VPN appliances across energy, oil, gas, and defense sectors.

"While no exploitation was confirmed during this phase, Dragos assesses with moderate confidence that the intent appeared to be pre-staging for future intrusions and exfiltration of operational data," according to the report.

New kids on the block

One of the three new groups that Dragos began tracking last year - Sylvanite - serves as Voltzite's initial access broker, responsible for weaponizing vulnerabilities and then handing off this access to Voltzite for deeper OT intrusions.

"Usually that indicates a government team and their national lab, or a government team and a contractor, or two different government agencies," Lee said.

Sylvanite exploits known vulnerabilities in internet-facing products from F5, Ivanti, and SAP to provide Voltzite access into electric power generation, transmission and distribution, water, sewage, and oil and gas organizations across North America, the UK, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.

"They're finding edge-device vulnerabilities - the things that a contractor or remote worker would use to get into operations networks," Lee said. "And within 48 hours of disclosure, they're reverse engineering [vulnerabilities] and hitting those devices."

A second group that emerged during 2025, Azurite, overlaps with China's Flax Typhoon and focuses on gaining long-term access to OT engineering workstations and exfiltrating operational files including network diagrams, alarm data, and process information for downstream capability development.

This group targets manufacturing, defense, automotive, electric power, oil and gas, and government organizations across the US, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region.

This is the FBI, open up. China's Volt Typhoon is on your network

Malware variants that target operational tech systems are very rare – but 2 were found last year

Amazon security boss blames Russia's GRU for years-long energy-sector hacks

Finally, the third new group, Pyroxene, overlaps with activity attributed to Imperial Kitten (aka APT35) - the cyber arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).

Dragos spotted Pyroxene conducting "supply chain-leveraged attacks targeting defense, critical infrastructure, and industrial sectors, with operations expanding from the Middle East into North America and Western Europe," according to the report.

One such intrusion involved collaboration between Pyroxene and a group Dragos tracks as Parisite, which functions as an initial access provider into critical infrastructure orgs.

Pyroxene typically uses recruitment-themed social engineering against targeted individuals, interacting with victims via fake social media profiles before delivering backdoors and other malware. In June 2025, Dragos said the group deployed data-wiping malware against "multiple undisclosed organizations" in Israel around the time of the military conflict between Iran, Israel, and the US.

Don't discount Russia

Of course, China and Iran aren't the only nations targeting critical infrastructure in America and around the globe. Russia also poses a threat to Western water and utilities - along with any nations helping Ukraine in its ongoing war against the Kremlin's occupation.

Dragos does not attribute cyberattacks to any nations. However, earlier this year, it blamed the December 2025 cyberattacks against Poland's power grid on a group it tracks as Electrum. This group overlaps with Russia's GRU-run Sandworm offensive cyber unit - the crew behind the 2022 attack on a Ukrainian power facility and earlier wiper attacks that coincided with Russia's ground invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

In its new report, Dragos said that Kamacite serves as the initial access provider for Electrum, and it detailed a reconnaissance campaign that Kamacite carried out against vulnerable internet-exposed industrial devices in US water, energy, and manufacturing sectors between March and July 2025.

"While Dragos found no evidence of successful exploitation during this period, the scope and precision of the scanning reveal a meaningful evolution in Kamacite's operational posture," the report said. ®

[20] TechCrunch Security - Intellexa’s Predator spyware used to hack iPhone of journalist in Angola, research says

[TAM METİN - 967 kelime]
A government customer of sanctioned spyware maker Intellexa hacked the phone of a prominent journalist in Angola, according to Amnesty International, the latest case of targeting someone in civil society with powerful phone-hacking software.

The human rights organization published a new report Tuesday analyzing several hacking attempts against local journalist and press freedom activist Teixeira Cândido, in which he was sent a series of malicious links via WhatsApp during 2024.

Cândido eventually clicked on one and his iPhone was hacked with Intellexa’s spyware, dubbed Predator, Amnesty found.

The new research shows again that government customers of commercial surveillance vendors are increasingly using spyware to target journalists, politicians, and other ordinary citizens, including critics. Researchers have previously found evidence of Predator abuse in Egypt, Greece, and Vietnam, where the government reportedly targeted U.S. officials by sending the spyware via links on X.

Intellexa is one of the most controversial spyware makers of the last few years, operating from different jurisdictions to skirt export laws and using an “opaque web of corporate entities” — as a U.S government official put it at the time — to hide its activities.

In 2024, around the same time one of Intellexa’s customers was targeting Cândido with its spyware, the outgoing Biden administration sanctioned the company, as well as its founder Tal Dilian and his business partner Sara Aleksandra Fayssal Hamou.

Earlier this year, the Treasury lifted sanctions against three other executives tied to Intellexa, a decision that left Senate Democrats demanding answers from the Trump administration.

Dilian did not respond to a request for comment.

Amnesty researchers wrote in the report that they linked the intrusions to Intellexa by examining forensic traces found on Cândido’s phone. Amnesty said that Intellexa used infection servers that had been previously linked to the company’s spyware infrastructure.

Several hours after clicking on the link that led to his phone hack, Cândido rebooted his phone, which wiped the spyware from his device. Amnesty said it wasn’t clear how the spyware was capable of hacking Cândido’s phone, as his phone was running an outdated version of iOS at the time.

The researchers found that Predator stayed hidden by impersonating legitimate iOS system processes to avoid detection.

Amnesty believes Cândido may be just one of many targets in the country, based on their findings that they were able to find multiple domains linked to the spyware maker used in Angola.

“The first domains linked to Angola were deployed as early as March 2023, indicating the start of Predator testing or deployment in the country,” wrote the Amnesty researchers, who added that they had no evidence to determine exactly who hacked Cândido.

“It is not currently possible to conclusively identify the customer of the Predator spyware in the country,” read the report.

Last year, based on leaks of internal documents, Amnesty and media organizations revealed that Intellexa employees had the ability to access customers’ systems remotely, potentially giving the spyware maker visibility into government surveillance operations.

Those leaks, like this report, shows that despite its controversies and sanctions, Intellexa has remained active in recent years.

“We’ve now seen confirmed abuses in Angola, Egypt, Pakistan, Greece, and beyond — and for every case we uncover, many more abuses surely remain hidden,” said Donncha Ó Cearbhaill, the head of the security lab at Amnesty International.

A new approach for GenAI risk protection

GenAI isn’t the real problem — unmanaged data is. Smarter XDR-based protection lets teams innovate without leaking what matters most.

When generative AI (GenAI) hit the consumer market with the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, users worldwide flocked to the product and started experimenting with the tool’s capabilities across industries. The release also sent an instant panic through the hearts of information security professionals whose job is to protect organizations from risks, including the loss or theft of sensitive data — including personally identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI) and sensitive corporate data and intellectual property.

Before we jump into protection mode, we must first ask ourselves: “What is it we are trying to protect with GenAI?” I see 3 primary objectives: 1) sensitive corporate data and intellectual property, 2) PII, PHI and 3) malware, maliciously generated code, etc.

What’s wrong with the tools we have?

Traditional enterprise data loss prevention (DLP) tools (such as Forta, Symantec, Netscope, Trellix, Microsoft, etc.) have been around for years, but are expensive, cumbersome to implement and require lots of care and feeding by IT professionals to make them effective in an organization. They offer comprehensive solutions typically built around data-centric and network-centric DLP, which integrates into data sources and monitors the network and any egress points. As a result, only large organizations with plenty of resources have the capability of deploying legacy DLP tools.

Fast forward to today with the combined risks associated with GenAI solutions. Unmanaged GenAI solutions and the consumer products offered by GenAI leaders — such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, Microsoft’s CoPilot and Anthropic’s Claude — allow users to upload documents, analyze information and generate a variety of outputs (text, audio, video, graphics, etc.). The risk to organizations is simple: staff uploading and analyzing sensitive data that includes PII, PHI or company proprietary or intellectual property puts organizational data at risk.

Most organizations today have GenAI policies and guidelines, but most lack the technology tools to implement those policies. I see a couple of good options for protecting sensitive data and cybersecurity risks in the GenAI world that include:

Solution 1: GenAI enterprise model

Implement enterprise licenses for approved GenAI solutions (such as ChatGPT Enterprise or Microsoft CoPilot 365, which is integrated into existing O365 tenants). Enterprise GenAI solutions typically include a robust set of built-in security tools that allow organizations to secure their data and implement DLP controls within the enterprise GenAI solution itself.

That said, these are expensive and typically run between $30 to $40 per user per month. For an organization of 4,000 staff, that’s $1,440,000 per year. With this approach, training can be optimized to the specific approved enterprise tools.

And of course, to reduce the risks of other non-approved GenAI tools — block them with modern-day internet content filtering tools like Cisco’s Umbrella, iBoss, DNSFilter or WEB Titan. The downside with this option is that organizations may risk locking out solutions that staff what, thus potentially stifling innovation. IT organizations must learn to read the room on what helps the business succeed and then figure out how to secure it. I consider this to be the risk-averse option.

Solution 2: GenAI open model

Implement GenAI DLP controls into your XDR/MDR (extended detection response/managed detection response) security solution to detect, analyze and respond to sensitive data loss risks. The core difference between modern-day XDR and traditional DLP solutions is that XDR combines multiple tools (endpoint, network security and threat intelligence) and DLP into the security solution, typically via an agent.

This option allows for more innovation to occur within your organization by not picking just one or two GenAI enterprise solutions and instead opening options to staff. That said, economies of scale for training go out the window as it’s difficult to train for dozens of different solutions within the enterprise.

Tier-1 solutions like Sentinel One, Microsoft and CrowdStrike offer robust DLP modules as part of their cybersecurity platforms, leveraging robust AI engines to detect and prevent sensitive data leaks from non-enterprise GenAI tools or any other tools for that matter. These tools can also secure your agentic AI by defining guardrails through threat and data protection and automated response across the full AI attack surface.

This approach shifts the layer of data loss risk from enterprise tool implementation to the endpoint. It also relieves the burden of leveraging an internet content-filtering tool to block non-enterprise GenAI solutions — allowing innovation to occur with less risk. XDR DLP is also much more cost-effective and runs between $30k and $50k per year for an organization of 4,000 staff. I consider this the risk-aware option.

Software solutions and vendors continue to innovate and evolve. The shift from enterprise DLP and internet content filtering or blocking solutions to XDR DLP modules as part of a cybersecurity platform demonstrates the integration of tools and capabilities as we enter 2026.

CIOs and CISOs must keep their focus on emerging tools that foster innovation (such as GenAI), while implementing policies and technologies to mitigate the risk of untamed or non-enterprise GenAI solutions. The remaining risks of GenAI (malware and maliciously generated code) can be handled by a combination of XDR and code security scanning solutions. As a result, XDR/MDR DLP is a solid, cost-effective option for the bulk of GenAI risks.

The new paradigm for raising up secure software engineers

The new challenge for CISOs in the age of AI developers is securing code. But what does developer security awareness even mean in the era of vibe coding?

CISOs were already struggling to help developers keep up with secure code principles at the speed of DevOps. Now, with AI-assisted development reshaping how code gets written and shipped, the challenge is rapidly intensifying.

Whereas only about 14% of enterprise software engineers regularly used AI coding assistants two years ago, that number is on its way to skyrocketing to 90% by 2028, according to Gartner projections. And research from analytics firms like Faros AI shows what that wide-scale adoption looks like in practice. Developers using AI are merging 98% more pull requests (PRs).

For security teams, this velocity creates a compounding problem. There’s more code, it’s produced faster, and there’s less time for review. Now, in theory AI tooling can help automate a lot of the more manual parts of the code review process. But in practice that’s not actually happening with much fidelity yet. And even as the effectiveness of AI-driven code review ramps ups, that wouldn’t mean the obsolescence of developer training anyway.

The training just needs to change. As AI tools get better at catching and fixing common code-level flaws, the focus of developer security training shifts to more fundamental principles around threat modeling for systemic software risks. What is needed to get thrown out are traditional training methods. Consensus among security leaders is that dev training needs to be bite-sized, hands-on, and mostly embedded in developer tool chains.

Refocusing from output to outcomes

As AI-assisted coding matures, the mechanics of catching common code-level vulnerabilities are increasingly going to be handled by the tools themselves. AI coding assistants paired with static analysis and automated remediation will be able to identify and fix many of the line-by-line flaws that developer security training has traditionally focused on. These are those pesky issues like SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and insecure configuration that security teams have nagged developers about for decades.

This should have CISOs rethinking how they approach developer enablement and training. Because even if automated scanning and remediation becomes table stakes in AI-assisted development, the review process at check-in is still likely to miss a ton of security weaknesses elsewhere.

“AI-generated code could be syntactically correct while contextually reckless,” says Ankit Gupta, senior security engineer at Exeter Finance and a AppSec advocate who’s worked to help developers deploy more secure software. “Developers are left to sift through AI output that is ‘plausible but untrusted.’ This shifts the focus of secure development to be more of a validation exercise than a creation exercise.”

Rather than focus on preparing developers for line-by-line code review, the emphasis moves toward evaluating whether their features and functions behave securely in context of deployment conditions, says Hasan Yasar, a secure DevOps advocate and the technical director of Rapid Fielding of High Assurance Software at the Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute. He says developers especially need to be able to pick up on risks in integration points, architecture, and logic.

“We are shifting from output to outcomes,” Yasar says, explaining that the goal is to get developers to look critically at how their systems work in actual runtime. “Outcomes are the features we are delivering to the users — do these functions or features work the way they’re supposed to?”

Emilio Pinna, director and co-founder of developer security training platform SecureFlag, says this represents a fundamental shift in what security awareness training needs to cover. “Five years ago, industry training taught specific patterns: ‘Don’t do this. Always do that,’” he says. “Today, training should also focus on the underlying principles so developers can evaluate any code, regardless of how it was generated.”

Developers need to recognize when AI-generated code introduces unsafe assumptions, insecure defaults, or integrations that can scale vulnerabilities across systems. And with more security enforcement built into automated engineering pipelines, developers should ideally also be trained to understand what automated gates catch, and what still requires human judgment. “Security awareness in engineering has shifted to a system-level approach rather than focusing on individual vulnerabilities,” Pinna says. “This includes issues such as identity and access control, dependencies, and supply-chain risks.”

Threat modeling as a core competency

This system-level thinking should also elevate the need for greater developer fluency in threat modeling, says Yasar. He notes that threat modeling has historically been difficult for product security and engineering teams to operationalize at scale. One of the longstanding barriers to practical threat modeling was the knowledge required to build effective threat models. Teams struggled to understand enough about the organizational context of how applications were being used, the architecture, and the relevant risks to tie it all together and identify the most relevant potential threats.

AI may actually help here. By synthesizing organizational context and architectural patterns, AI can make it easier to build threat models that would have previously required extensive manual effort, Yasar says. But while AI can accelerate the mechanics of threat modeling, developers still need to understand the fundamentals: how to think about trust boundaries, how to identify assets worth protecting, and how to anticipate how attackers might abuse a feature. CISOs looking to shift developer training away from vulnerability avoidance may want to start weaving threat modeling skills as a core competency instead.

This means that CTOs and CISOs need to help developers and the rest of the engineering team to start to cultivate “threat modeling intuition,” says Michael Bell, founder and CEO of Suzu Labs. “It cannot be a simple ‘does this code work?’ check. But needs to morph into ‘how could this be abused?’,” he says. “We are offloading a large portion of the mental load to write the code, so let’s focus that opened time and opportunity to review the code being output.”

Bell believes that building up threat modeling intuition requires a higher level of hands-on and immersive training like work in cyber ranges that shows developers how attackers would target their applications. “As AI handles more of the routine coding work, the human value shifts to judgment,” he says. “Hands-on training builds judgment in a way that lectures and videos don’t.”

Baking training cues into guardrails

The real trick to hands-on training is figuring out how to serve it up to developers in a high-velocity engineering environment. AI-assisted coding is only accelerating workflows and making production expectations even more breathless. A CISO asking to slow things down for training will get considerable side-eye from CTOs under the gun.

“Traditional, static, one-time courses don’t work in today’s development lifecycle,” says Pinna. “What’s proving effective is continuous, hands-on training in labs with realistic engineering scenarios. They also need contextual, just-in-time learning.”

The emerging approach among secure coding leaders is to blend platform engineering with targeted developer engineering, embedding security guidance directly into the workflows and tools developers already use. Rather than expecting developers to remember what they learned in last year’s training, security teams should be building guardrails that teach as they enforce, Pinna says.

“Security teams are creating guardrails that scale across development pipelines,” says Pinna. “These guardrails turn risks into guidance for developers and make sure that automated tools reinforce training. The goal is for training and enforcement to work together, so coming across a guardrail also helps developers understand security principles.”

Gupta describes a similar vision: “Instead of expecting users to read documentation, security expectations are built into pipelines, with pop-up explanations justifying the presence of a control and describing how to comply.”

It may even expand beyond a pop-up. Delivering on-demand micro-learning in five-, ten-, and fifteen-minute increments based on the exact issue the developer has run into can be incredibly powerful. “The tools I’m using should help me out to learn,” Yasar says.

The data from guardrails and controls being triggered can be used by the AppSec team to drive creation and delivery of more in-depth, but targeted education. When the same vulnerability or integration pattern pops up again and again, that’s a signal for focused training on a subject.

“AppSec teams play a critical role in connecting automated findings to training,” Bell says. “When the same issue appears repeatedly, that’s a training opportunity.”

The CISO’s new training agenda

Smart CISOs likely already understand that the vibe-coding landscape is going to demand more rather than less security savvy from the dev team. This will require security leaders to work more closely than ever with engineering leadership to influence a shift in the content and delivery mechanisms of security awareness training.

Beyond the basics already described here, security pundits say that there’s also another new security training wildcard that CISOs will desperately need to address as AI-assisted coding takes hold within their organization. Developers will now need training in how to work securely within the AI tools themselves.

“CISOs need to ask: how can I train my engineers to use AI tools with a security mindset?” says Yasar. “How can I teach them to evaluate and verify what they’re asking and what they’re receiving from these tools? That’s going to come down to governance.”

This means working with CTOs and other relevant stakeholders to establish clear policies that define when AI-assisted code requires human review, what types of data can be used with AI tools, and how AI usage is governed before code reaches production. Gupta says organizations are already starting to formalize these rules as part of their broader developer enablement programs.

There’s also an opportunity here to finally make good on long-unachieved secure-by-design goals. CISOs can work with engineering teams to use prompt engineering guidance to embed security requirements at the point of code generation. Security teams that offer developers training and ready-made prompt language will help them produce more secure software from the start.

“Now I can bake compliance into my prompt. I can build up compliance by design into my architectures,” Yasar explains. “If I’m a developer I can prompt the tool to build me a web login and make sure that web login follows HITRUST compliance guidelines. I can say ‘here are the guidelines in detail.’ That’s going to give us a very good opportunity to insert compliance by design into the prompt itself.”

In this way, CISOs can harness the shift to AI-assisted coding in a way that helps build more resilient software than ever.

The bottom line is that developer training is here to stay. But CISOs need to put in the work to influence changes that embed security judgment into engineering culture. This means working hand-in-hand with CTOs to weave threat modeling, guardrails, and AI governance wisdom directly into the tools developers use every day.

13 Fragen gegen Drittanbieterrisiken

Third-Party-Anbieter können schnell zum Security-Verhängnis werden. Mit den richtigen Fragen vor Vertragsschluss können CISOs die Risiken reduzieren.

Miljan Zivkovic | shutterstock.com

Die zunehmende Abhängigkeit von IT-Dienstleistern und Software von Drittanbietern vergrößert die Angriffsfläche von Unternehmen erheblich. Das wird auch durch zahlreiche Cyberattacken immer wieder unterstrichen. Zwar lassen sich die Risiken in Zusammenhang mit Third-Party-Anbietern nicht gänzlich beseitigen, aber durchaus reduzieren. Dabei sollten Sicherheitsentscheider eine zentrale Rolle spielen, wie Randy Gross, CISO bei CompTIA, erklärt: “CISOs sind in der einzigartigen Lage, den gesamten Geschäftsprozess zu überblicken – Datenflüsse, Abhängigkeiten und nachgelagerte Auswirkungen. Dennoch nutzen viele Unternehmen diese Perspektive noch immer nicht, um Risiken durch Dritte neu zu bewerten.”

Insbesondere, wenn Verträge auf Ebene von Geschäftseinheiten verhandelt werden oder unterhalb der finanziellen Genehmigungsschwellen liegen, bleiben Sicherheitschefs jedoch oftmals außen vor. Das beobachtet auch Melissa Ventrone, Leiterin der Abteilung für Cybersicherheit bei der Anwaltskanzlei Clark Hill: “In vielen Unternehmen werden Sicherheitsverantwortliche erst nach Vertragsabschluss hinzugezogen. Oder wenn ein Sicherheitsproblem bereits aufgetreten ist.”

Tatsächlich sollten CISOs an dieser Stelle als pragmatische Technologieberater fungieren, die wichtige Informationen einholen, für deren Bewertung sie besonders qualifiziert sind.

13 Fragen, die Sie Drittanbietern stellen sollten

Die folgenden Fragen unterstützen CISOs und Sicherheitsentscheider dabei, das in der Praxis umzusetzen.

1. Welche Nachweise für angemessene Sicherheitskontrollen können Sie erbringen?

Laut Juan Pablo Perez-Etchegoyen, CTO beim Security-Anbieter Onapsis, zählen folgende Nachweise dabei zu den gängigsten:

SOC 2 Typ II (gilt als Goldstandard für Auditierungen von IT- und Cloud-Dienstleistern),

Cloud Security Alliance STAR (speziell für Cloud-Anbieter, kombiniert ISO 27001 mit einer Kontrollmatrix für Cloud-bezogene Risiken), sowie

branchenspezifische Zertifizierungen (zum Beispiel HIPAA/HITRUST für den Umgang mit Gesundheitsdaten oder PCI DSS für die Verarbeitung von Kreditkartendaten).

2. Wie werden diese Kontrollen aktualisiert und wie werden wesentliche Änderungen kommuniziert?

Anwältin Ventrone empfiehlt zudem,potenzielle IT-Partner mit einem detaillierten Due-Diligence-Fragebogen zu konfrontieren. Darüber hinaus empfiehlt die Rechtsexpertin, spezifische Aspekte vertraglich zu verankern: “Drittanbietern sollte es mindestens untersagt sein, Sicherheitskontrollen zu verändern, die das Schutzniveau oder die Ausfallsicherheit Ihrer Systeme und Daten beeinträchtigen würden.”

3. Wer ist in Ihrem Team für die Identity Posture zuständig und wie erkennt derjenige Anfragen, die auf Social Engineering zurückzuführen sind?

Welche Form von Zugriff das Team des Drittanbieters auf Kundensysteme und -daten hat und wie dieser segmentiert und abgesichert ist, sollten Sicherheitsentscheider nach Meinung von Casey Corcoran, Field CISO beim Managed-Service-Anbieter Stratascale, unbedingt erfragen. “Achten Sie darauf, dass dieser Zugriff protokolliert sowie überwacht wird – und bei Bedarf sofort widerrufen werden kann.”

Zudem sollten Sicherheitsverantwortliche dabei die richtigen Aspekte ins Auge fassen, wie John Alford, CSO bei der Unternehmensberatung TeraType, betont: “Viele Kunden konzentrieren sich auf Firewalls, Endpunkt-Agenten und MFA – übersehen dabei aber die Trust-Pfade, die Angreifer bevorzugt nutzen: Helpdesk-Workflows, OAuth-Integrationen, Lieferanten-Support-Portale und Automatisierungs-Konnektoren.”

Alford empfiehlt seinen Berufskollegen außerdem, auf streng definierte Rollenbereiche, mehrstufige Verifizierungen sowie Approval Chains für den Reset von Anmeldedaten zu achten. “Ist nichts davon vorhanden, deutet das auf blinde Flecken hin, die sich nachträglich nicht beseitigen lassen.”

4. Wie lassen sich Ihre Workflows verifizieren? Können Sie Nachweise über deren Wirksamkeit erbringen?

Viele Unternehmen unterschätzen, wie viel operatives Vertrauen sie wirklich an Anbieter abgeben. Deswegen sollten Drittanbieter nicht nur Richtlinien-Dokumente vorweisen können, sondern auch Workflow Maps, Execution-Protokolle und Testing-Belege. “Die größten Lücken treten regelmäßig an den Stellen zutage, die vermeintlich sicher sind. Ich habe schon erlebt, wie gestandene Unternehmen mit ausgeprägten Standards und Kontrollmaßnahmen an Problemen gescheitert sind, für die ausschließlich die Workflows ihres Third-Party-Anbieters verantwortlich waren”, plaudert Alford aus dem Nähkästchen.

Risikobewertungen sollten sich seiner Meinung nach deshalb nicht bloß auf auf Server und Netzwerke konzentrieren, sondern auch auf Identitäts-Workflows und manuell gesteuerte Prozesse: “Wenn man den Blickwinkel erweitert, entdeckt man unter Umständen Kontrollmaßnahmen, die lediglich auf dem Papier gut aussehen.”

5. Welche Rolle spielt unabhängiges Testing bei Ihnen und wie oft wird das eingesetzt?

Geht es um Security-Tests und -bewertungen bei IT-Partnern, sollten CISOs Wert darauflegen, dass diese von unabhängigen Dritten durchgeführt werden, meint Rechtsexpertin Ventrone. “Das sollte mindestens einmal pro Jahr stattfinden – und bei wesentlichen Änderungen an Netzwerk, Infrastruktur oder Sicherheitskontrollmaßnahmen. Die Zusammenfassungen von Schwachstellen-Scans, Penetrationstests und Audits sollten Sie sich ebenfalls zeigen lassen.”

Danny Jenkins, CEO beim Security-Anbieter ThreatLocker, stellt insbesondere auf die Frequenz dieser Überprüfungen ab: “Bedrohungen entwickeln sich ständig weiter. Eine jährliche Prüfung reicht deshalb nicht aus. Sämtliche Systeme sollten regelmäßig Penetrationstests unterzogen und optimiert werden.”

6. Können Sie sämtliche OAuth-Integrationen und API-Beziehungen in Ihrem Service auflisten und erklären, wie diese definiert, überwacht und widerrufen werden?

OAuth-Integrationen werden nach Einschätzung von Teratype-CSO Alford allzu oft als harmlose Annehmlichkeiten behandelt – statt als High-Privilege-Kanäle: “In Wirklichkeit funktionieren sie wie ein Netzwerk aus vergessenen Tunneln. Sie bieten eine Möglichkeit, das Eingangstor vollständig zu umgehen und verbinden Systeme tief im Inneren der Umgebung.”

Unternehmen sollten ihre Drittanbieter deshalb auffordern, ein Token-Inventar inklusive Minimal Scopes, endlichen Laufzeiten sowie einer Möglichkeit zum Behavioral Monitoring bereitzustellen, so Alford. Permanent gültige Token sieht der Experte hingegen als Warnsignal, das auf ein erhöhtes Risiko hindeutet.

7. Wie sehen Ihre vertraglichen und operativen Pflichten aus, wenn ein Angreifer Ihre Prozesse missbraucht, ohne dabei in Systeme einzudringen?

Wenn Drittanbieter Passwörter zurücksetzen oder OAuth-Integrationen managen können, wird der Vertrag zu einem Kontrolldokument. Dieses definiert, wie das Risiko geteilt wird und welche Nachweise der Kunde verlangen kann. An dieser Stelle ist es besonders wichtig, Sicherheitsentscheider in die Verhandlungen mit Third-Party-Anbietern einzubeziehen, wie Alford betont: “Ohne die Beteiligung des CISO bleiben Vertragsklauseln in der Regel eher nachteilig ausgestaltet. Das liegt daran, dass der Fokus ohne Security-Perspektive vor allem auf der Verfügbarkeit liegt – und nicht so sehr auf der Sicherheit. Als Kunde sollten Sie darauf bestehen, dass sich die Pflichten des Anbieters nicht nur auf kompromittierte Systeme, sondern auch kompromittierte Prozesse erstrecken.”

8. Welche Kontrollmaßnahmen kommen zum Einsatz, um die Aktivitäten Ihrer Mitarbeiter in unserer Umgebung zu kontrollieren? Und wie erkennen wir Verhalten, das von der Norm abweicht?

“Moderne Angriffskampagnen machen sich Vertrauensbeziehungen und weiche Betriebsprozesse zunutze. Die Gefahr lauert dabei oft dort, wo sie niemand erwartet – beispielsweise Helpdesks”, warnt Alford. Die Aktivitäten der Belegschaft von Drittanbietern zu überwachen sei daher erfolgsentscheidend. Der Sicherheitsprofi empfiehlt deshalb, darauf zu bestehen, dass der Partner Sessions aufzeichnet, Echzeit-Alarmmeldungen zur Verfügung stellt und Aufgaben strikt getrennt werden.

9. Wie isolieren Sie unsere Assets und Daten von denen anderer Kunden?

Mit Blick auf potenzielle Third-Party-Anbieter sollten CISOs zudem auf eine klare Architektur und konkrete Maßnahmen achten, die Schaden begrenzen können. Dabei spielt auch eine Rolle, wie der Drittanbieter Risiken in seinen eigenen Lieferketten managt. “IT-Partner sollten über ein robustes Vendor-Management-Programm verfügen und ihre eigenen Dienstleister einer angemessenen Due-Diligence-Prüfung unterziehen”, rät Ventrone.

10. Wie schnell werden wir über Sicherheitsvorfälle informiert, die sich auf unsere Daten oder Systeme auswirken?

Von IT-Partnern über potenzielle Sicherheitsvorfälle informiert zu werden, sollte selbstverständlich sein. Dabei sollte jedoch auch eine Rolle spielen, wie zeitnah das erfolgt. Stratascale-Field-CISO Corcoran empfiehlt diesbezüglich: “Der Vertrag sollte eine Meldung des Drittanbieters innerhalb von 24 bis 72 Stunden garantieren. Darüber hinaus sollten Security-Verantwortliche auch auf einen getesteten Incident-Response-Plan sowie weitere vertraglich verankerte Verantwortlichkeiten achten.”

Auch Alford sieht bei diesem Punkt kein Potenzial für Kompromisse – Drittanbieter müssten ihren Kunden ausreichend Informationen zur Verfügung stellen, damit diese ihre eigenen Threat-Analysen fahren können: “Geschieht das nicht, können sich Kundenunternehmen lediglich noch auf die Detection- und Reporting-Funktion des Hosting-Anbieters stützen.”

11. Wie identifizieren, priorisieren und beheben Sie Schwachstellen?

Da nicht wenige Cyberattacken auf bereits bekannte Schwachstellen abzielen, gilt es bei der Evaluierung von Drittanbietern auch auf Patch-Richtlinien und Remediation-Fristen zu achten. Onapsis-CTO Perez-Etchegoyen klärt über die Risiken in diesem Zusammenhang auf: “Langsame Patch-Zyklen können zu Lieferkettenunterbrechungen, betrieblichen Problemen und manchmal auch zur Insolvenz führen.”

Ventrone führt an dieser Stelle das Beispiel eines Unternehmens an, das sein Firewall-Management an einen Drittanbieter ausgelagert hat: “Nachdem eine Schwachstelle in der Firewall ausgenutzt worden war, stellte der Partner schließlich die anfällige Version wieder her – was zu einer zweiten Kompromittierung führte. Um es salopp zu sagen: So etwas kann man sich nicht ausdenken”, konstatiert die Anwältin.

12. Verfügen Sie über eine Cyberversicherung, die mögliche Auswirkungen auf sämtliche Ihrer Kunden abdeckt?

Laut Joshua Wright, Faculty Fellow beim SANS Institute, werden die Attacken auf SaaS-Anbieter in Zukunft weiter steigen – und damit auch die nachgelagerten Risiken: “Wird ein solcher Drittanbieter kompromittiert, entstehen diverse Möglichkeiten für Folgeangriffe – etwa mit Ransomware.”

Ventrone empfiehlt CISOs deshalb, in Verhandlungen mit Drittanbietern auch sicherzustellen, dass deren Cyberversicherungspolice nicht nur das eigene Unternehmen abdeckt, sondern auch den gesamten Impact eines Vorfalls, bei dem mehrere Kunden betroffen sind.

13. Können wir Ihre Prozesse testen?

SANS-Experte Wright hält darüber hinaus auch Nachweise für Testing und Monitoring für unerlässlich – etwa bezogen auf Penetrationstests, Security Monitoring oder Threat Hunting. Alford empfiehlt allerdings, noch einen Schritt weiter zu gehen: “Prozesstests unter Einbeziehung realistischer Szenarien können aufdecken, wo tatsächlich Risiken bestehen. Das gibt Ihnen zudem die Möglichkeit, Kontrollen zu entwickeln, die der Denkweise von Angreifern entsprechen und nicht dem, was in der Dokumentation steht.” (fm)

[24] CSO Online - Cyber attacks enabled by basic failings, Palo Alto analysis finds

Cyber attacks enabled by basic failings, Palo Alto analysis finds

Time to exploit drops to 72 minutes as AI automation accelerates cyberattacks.

Cyberattacks are moving faster, shrinking the gap between initial compromise and bad consequences, and the advent of AI is accelerating their timelines in a way that human defenders can no longer keep up with.

That’s the broad and perhaps unsurprising finding of Palo Alto Networks’ 2026 Global Incident Response Report, which analyzed 750 incidents in 50 countries that were investigated by the company’s Unit 42 global threat intelligence and incident response team.

In the fastest attacks analyzed, threat actors moved from initial access to data exfiltration in 72 minutes, down from nearly five hours in 2024. Increasingly, this is explained by AI’s ability to compress timelines for reconnaissance, phishing, scripting, and operational execution, the company said.

However, a closer look offers CISOs a crumb of comfort: what is really killing organizations isn’t so much fast-moving attackers or the wolf of AI, but basic failings such as weak authentication, a lack of real-time visibility, and misconfigurations caused by a complex sprawl of security systems.

In theory, these are all fixable. As the authors observe: “Despite the speed and automation we’re seeing, most of the incidents we respond to don’t start with something radically new. They start with gaps that show up again and again. In many cases, attackers didn’t rely on a sophisticated exploit, but on an overlooked exposure.”

A recurring theme is the struggle many organizations have with identity and trust, which Unit 42 found played a role in 90% of the incidents it investigated. Attacker tactics included social engineering in 33% of incidents, identity-based phishing in 22%, credential abuse and brute force in 21%, and insider threats in 8%.

Too many accounts have excessive permissions; this was the case for 99% of the 680,000 cloud users, roles, and services analyzed by Unit 42, including some that had been unused for 60 days or more. It’s an identity attack surface that keeps expanding faster than the underlying issues can be addressed, as organizations add ever more cloud, SaaS, and AI applications.

Increasingly, these identities relate to machine identities (service accounts, automation roles, API keys, AI agents), shadow identities (unsanctioned accounts, developer environments, and third parties), and identity “silos” (on-premises AD plus multiple cloud identity providers).

“Rarely does an attack stay in one environment. Instead, we see coordinated activity across endpoints, networks, cloud, SaaS, and identity, forcing defenders to monitor across all of them at once,” said Unit 42.

Supply chains are another vulnerable area. In 23% of incidents, attackers were able to exploit third-party SaaS applications, bypassing traditional security controls. “When an upstream provider reported a compromise or outage, customers were often left to stop and answer a basic question: are we affected? In many cases, they had limited visibility into their own exposure,” Unit 42 said.

Changing the paradigm

Unit 42’s answer to this endless cycle of attackers always being one step ahead of defenders is to change the paradigm: cybersecurity has become so specialized, it says, that the answer is to use a managed service built from the ground up to counter real rather than abstract threats.

With that in mind, Palo Alto Networks this week launched a new SOC service, Unit 42 Managed Extended Security Intelligence and Automation Management (XSIAM) 2.0. This, the company claims, has expanded its XSIAM 1.0 to include complete onboarding, threat hunting and response, and the modelling of attack patterns faster than a traditional SOC.

Is this persuasive? CISOs will have heard this message before: the old stuff no longer works, so invest in something new. And there is always an old system or service that needs ripping out to be replaced by a shiner, new one.

To complicate matters, the idea of ever more advanced SOCs might not be a panacea. Some have even argued that that SOCs themselves can end up constrained by the same issues of skills shortages and budget constraints as traditional IT departments.

As Palo Alto Networks puts it: “The window for defense has collapsed, and most SOCs weren’t built for the speed of today’s attacks.” So, out with old tools such as traditional SIEMs and SOAR, which merely generate alerts; the modern AI-powered SOC should act on them “at machine speed.”
