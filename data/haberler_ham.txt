Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a new Android trojan called Massiv that's designed to facilitate device takeover (DTO) attacks for financial theft.

The malware, according to ThreatFabric, masquerades as seemingly harmless IPTV apps to deceive victims, indicating that the activity is primarily singling out users looking for the online TV applications.

"This new threat, while only seen in a limited number of rather targeted campaigns, already poses a great risk to the users of mobile banking, allowing its operators to remotely control infected devices and perform device takeover attacks with further fraudulent transactions performed from the victim's banking accounts," the Dutch mobile security company said in a report shared with The Hacker News.

ThreatFabric told The Hacker News via email that the malware was first spotted in a campaign targeting users in Portugal and Greece earlier this year, although it has observed samples dating back to the start of 2025 as part of smaller test campaigns.

Like various Android banking malware families, Massiv supports a wide range of features to facilitate credential theft through a number of methods: screen streaming through Android's MediaProjection API, keylogging, SMS interception, and fake overlays served atop banking and financial apps. The overlay asks users to enter their credentials and credit card details.

One such campaign has been found to target gov.pt, a Portuguese public administration app that allows users to store identification documents and manage the Digital Mobile Key (aka Chave Móvel Digital or CMD). The overlay tricks users into entering their phone number and PIN code, likely in an effort to bypass Know Your Customer (KYC) verification.

ThreatFabric said it identified cases where scammers used the information captured through these overlays to open new banking accounts in the victim's name, allowing them to be used for money laundering or getting loans approved without the actual victim's knowledge.

In addition, it serves as a fully functional remote-control tool, granting the operator the ability to access the victim's device stealthily while showing a black screen overlay to conceal the malicious activity. These techniques, realized by abusing Android's accessibility services, have also been observed in several other Android bankers like Crocodilus, Datzbro, and Klopatra.

"However, some applications implement protection against screen capture," the company explained. "To bypass it, Massiv uses so-called UI-tree mode -- it traverses AccessibilityWindowInfo roots and recursively processes AccessibilityNodeInfo objects."

This is done so as to build a JSON representation of visible text and content descriptions, UI elements, screen coordinates, and interaction flags that indicate whether the UI element is clickable, editable, focused, or enabled. Only nodes that are visible and have text are exported to the attacker, who can then determine the next course of action by issuing specific commands to interact with the device.

The malware is equipped to carry out a wide range of malicious actions -

Enable black overlay, mute sounds and vibration

Send device information

Perform click and swipe actions

Alter clipboard with specific text

Turn on/off screen streaming

Unlock device with pattern

Serve overlays for an app, device pattern lock, or PIN

Download ZIP archive with overlays for targeted applications

Download and install APK files

Open Battery Optimization, Device Admin, and Play Protect settings screens

Rquest for permissions to access SMS messages, install APK packages,

Clear log databases on the device

Massiv is distributed in the form of dropper apps mimicking IPTV apps via SMS phishing. Once installed and launched, the dropper prompts the victim to install an "important" update by granting it permissions to install software from external sources. The names of the malicious artifacts are listed below -

IPTV24 (hfgx.mqfy.fejku) - Dropper

Google Play (hobfjp.anrxf.cucm) - Massiv

"In most of the cases observed, it is just masquerading," ThreatFabric said. "No actual IPTV applications were infected or initially contained malicious code. Usually, the dropper that mimics an IPTV app opens a WebView with an IPTV website in it, while the actual malware is already installed and running on the device."

The majority of Android malware campaigns using TV-related droppers have targeted Spain, Portugal, France, and Turkey over the past six months.

Massiv is the latest entrant to an already crowded Android threat landscape, reflecting the continuing demand for such turnkey solutions among cybercriminals.

"While not yet observed being promoted as Malware-as-a-Service, Massiv's operator shows clear signs of going this path, introducing API keys to be used in malware communication with the backend," ThreatFabric said. "Code analysis revealed ongoing development, with more features likely to be introduced in the future."

[2] The Hacker News - CRESCENTHARVEST Campaign Targets Iran Protest Supporters With RAT Malware
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 945 kelime]
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a new campaign dubbed CRESCENTHARVEST, likely targeting supporters of Iran's ongoing protests to conduct information theft and long-term espionage.

The Acronis Threat Research Unit (TRU) said it observed the activity after January 9, with the attacks designed to deliver a malicious payload that serves as a remote access trojan (RAT) and information stealer to execute commands, log keystrokes, and exfiltrate sensitive data. It's currently not known if any of the attacks were successful.

"The campaign exploits recent geopolitical developments to lure victims into opening malicious .LNK files disguised as protest-related images or videos," researchers Subhajeet Singha, Eliad Kimhy, and Darrel Virtusio said in a report published this week.

"These files are bundled with authentic media and a Farsi-language report providing updates from 'the rebellious cities of Iran.' This pro- protest framing appears to be intended to increase credibility and to attract Farsi-speaking Iranians seeking protest-related information."

CRESCENTHARVEST, although unattributed, is believed to be the work of an Iran-aligned threat group. The discovery makes it the second such campaign identified as going after specific individuals in the aftermath of the nationwide protests in Iran that began towards the end of 2025.

Last month, French cybersecurity company HarfangLab detailed a threat cluster dubbed RedKitten that targeted non-governmental organizations and individuals involved in documenting recent human rights abuses in Iran with an aim to infect them with a custom backdoor known as SloppyMIO.

According to Acronis, the exact initial access vector used to distribute the malware is not known. However, it's suspected that the threat actors are relying on spear-phishing or "protracted social engineering efforts" in which the operators build rapport with the victims over time before sending the malicious payloads.

It's worth noting that Iranian hacking groups like Charming Kitten and Tortoiseshell have a storied history of engaging in sophisticated social-engineered attacks that involve approaching prospective targets under fake personas and cultivating a relationship with them, in some cases even stretching for years, before weaponizing the trust to infect them with malware.

"The use of Farsi language content for social engineering and the distributed files depicting the protests in heroic terms suggest an intent to attract Farsi-speaking individuals of Iranian origin, who are in support of the ongoing protests," the Swiss-based security company noted.

The starting point of the attack chain is a malicious RAR archive that claims to contain information related to the Iranian protests, including various images and videos, along with two Windows shortcut (LNK) files that masquerade as an image or a video file by using the double extension trick (*.jpg.lnk or *.mp4.lnk).

The deceptive file, once launched, contains PowerShell code to retrieve another ZIP archive, while simultaneously opening a harmless image or video, tricking the victim into thinking that they have interacted with a benign file.

Present within the ZIP archive is a legitimate Google-signed binary ("software_reporter_tool.exe") shipped as part of Chrome's cleanup utility and several DLL files, including two rogue libraries that are sideloaded by the executable to realize the threat actor's objectives -

urtcbased140d_d.dll, a C++ implant that extracts and decrypts Chrome's app-bound encryption keys through COM interfaces. It shares overlaps with an open-source project known as ChromElevator.

version.dll (aka CRESCENTHARVEST), a remote access tool that lists installed antivirus products and security tools, enumerates local user accounts on the device, loads DLLs, harvests system metadata, browser credentials, Telegram desktop account data, and keystrokes.

CRESCENTHARVEST employs Windows Win HTTP APIs to communicate with its command-and-control (C2) server ("servicelog-information[.]com"), allowing it to blend in with regular traffic. Some of the supported commands are listed below -

Anti, to run anti-analysis checks

His, to steal browser history

Dir, to list directories

Cwd, to get the current working directory

Cd, to change directory

GetUser, to get user information

ps, to run PowerShell commands (not working)

KeyLog, to activate keylogger

Tel_s, to steal Telegram session data

Info, to steal system information

F_log, to steal browser credentials

Upload, to upload files

shell, to run shell commands

"The CRESCENTHARVEST campaign represents the latest chapter in a decade-long pattern of suspected nation-state cyber espionage operations targeting journalists, activists, researchers, and diaspora communities globally," Acronis said. "Much of what we observed in CRESCENTHARVEST reflects well-established tradecraft: LNK-based initial access, DLL side-loading through signed binaries, credential harvesting and social engineering aligned to current events."

The disclosure comes days after The New York Times revealed that Iran's government likely tracked protesters' locations through their phones to warn them over a text message that their "presence at illegal gatherings" had been recorded and that they were under "intelligence monitoring."

The move, it said, was an attempt to crack down dissent. According to a report published by Iran-focused digital rights group Holistic Resilience last week, some people who posted on social media about the protests and other political topics have had their SIM cards suspended.

"The Islamic Republic is building a distinct model of digital control and surveillance, one that is not based on permanent isolation but on conditional and interruptible connectivity," RaazNet said.

"The central pillar of this model is the National Information Network (NIN). Unlike traditional physical infrastructure, such as roads or factories, the NIN is not a static state project. Like other digital systems, it evolves continuously alongside advances in communications technologies, undergoes regular versioning, and is expanded in response to changing technical and political requirements."

The move is part of a broader effort that combines information gleaned from e-government databases, surveillance cameras, as well as malware deployed via social engineering to establish remote access and monitor its citizens' movements online in a sustained manner. One such tool is a lightweight modular trojan called 2Ac2 RAT that's designed for victim device control and data collection.

[TAM METİN - 398 kelime]
African law enforcement agencies arrested 651 suspects and recovered over $4.3 million in a joint operation targeting investment fraud, mobile money scams, and fake loan applications.

As INTERPOL revealed on Wednesday, Operation Red Card 2.0 identified 1,247 victims between December 8 and January 30 while targeting cybercrime operations linked to over $45 million in financial losses.

Authorities across 16 countries also seized 2,341 devices and took down 1,442 malicious websites, domains, and servers during this joint action coordinated by the African Joint Operation against Cybercrime (AFJOC).

In Nigeria, police officers dismantled an investment fraud ring that was recruiting young people to run phishing, identity theft, and fake investment schemes, taking down over 1,000 fraudulent social media accounts in the process. They also arrested six members of a Nigerian cybercrime gang that used stolen employee credentials to breach a major telecom provider.

Kenyan investigators also apprehended 27 suspects while investigating fraud networks that used social media and messaging platforms to lure victims into fake investment schemes.

In Côte d'Ivoire, 58 suspects were arrested as part of a crackdown on predatory mobile loan apps that targeted victims with hidden fees and abusive debt-collection practices.

"These organized cybercriminal syndicates inflict devastating financial and psychological harm on individuals, businesses and entire communities with their false promises," said Neal Jetton, the head of INTERPOL's Cybercrime Directorate.

"Operation Red Card highlights the importance of collaboration when combatting transnational cybercrime. I encourage all victims of cybercrime to reach out to law enforcement for help."

One year ago, African law enforcement arrested another 306 suspects in the first stage of this INTERPOL-led operation targeting cross-border cybercriminal networks.

This is the latest INTERPOL operation targeting African cybercrime, with thousands of arrests and multiple multimillion-dollar operations disrupted or dismantled in recent years, following Operation Serengeti and Operation Africa Cyber Surge.

[4] BleepingComputer - New 'Massiv' Android banking malware poses as an IPTV app
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-massiv-android-banking-malware-poses-as-an-iptv-app/

[TAM METİN - 526 kelime]
A new Android banking malware, which researchers named Massiv, is posing as an IPTV app to steal digital identities and access online banking accounts.

The malware relies on screen overlays and keylogging to obtain sensitive data and can take remote control of a compromised device.

In a campaign observed by researchers at fraud detection and mobile threat intelligence company ThreatFabric, Massiv targeted a Portuguese government app that connects with Chave Móvel Digital - Portugal’s digital authentication and signature system.

The two service contain user data that could be used to bypass know-your-customer (KYC) verifications or to access banking accounts and other public and private online services.

“MTI research identified cases where new accounts were opened in the name of the victim (user of the infected device) in new banks and services (not used by the victim),” describes the ThreatFabric report.

“Since those accounts are fully under fraudster control, they can further use them as a part of money laundering scheme as well as getting loans and cashing out the money, leaving unsuspecting victim in debts in the bank they never opened account themselves.”

Massiv provides two remote control modes for its operators: a screen live-streaming mode that leverages Android’s MediaProjection API, and a UI-tree mode that extracts structured data from the Accessibility Service.

The latter includes visible text, interface element names, screen coordinates, and interaction attributes, allowing attackers to click buttons, edit text fields, and more.

This second mode is particularly helpful for bypassing screen-capture protections commonly used in banking, communication, and other apps that host sensitive content.

IPTV lures on the rise

An interesting trend identified by ThreatFabric through the discovery of Massiv is the increasing use of IPTV apps as lures for Android malware infections, a technique that has increased over the past eight months.

These apps typically play a key role in copyright infringement, so they cannot be found on Google Play due to policy violations. Sourcing them as APKs from unofficial channels is considered normal for their users, who are accustomed to sideloading them.

In most cases, the IPTV app is fake, does not offer access to pirated broadcasts, and the APK is a dropper that installs the malware payload. In some cases, the app displays a legitimate IPTV website in a WebView to maintain the illusion.

The researchers report that fake IPTV-masking malware droppers have primarily targeted users in Spain, Portugal, France, and Turkey.

Android users are recommended to only download vetted apps from reputable publishers available on official channels (Google Play), keep Play Protect active, and use it to regularly scan the device.

[5] Security Affairs - Irish regulator probes X after Grok allegedly generated sexual images of children
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 19 Feb 2026 09:53:32 +0000

[TAM METİN - 622 kelime]
Ireland’s Data Protection Commission has launched another investigation into X over Grok’s AI image generator. The probe focuses on reports that the tool created large volumes of non-consensual and sexualized images, including content involving children, potentially violating EU data protection laws.

“The Data Protection Commission (DPC) has today announced that it has opened an inquiry into X Internet Unlimited Company (XIUC) under section 110 of the Data Protection Act 2018.” reads the Ireland’s DPC’s press release. “The inquiry concerns the apparent creation, and publication on the X platform, of potentially harmful, non-consensual intimate and/or sexualised images, containing or otherwise involving the processing of personal data of EU/EEA data subjects, including children, using generative artificial intelligence functionality associated with the Grok large language model within the X platform.”

In January, X’s safety team blocked the @Grok account from editing images of real people to add revealing clothing, such as bikinis, for all users. Image creation and editing features now remain available only to paid subscribers, adding an accountability layer to deter abuse and policy violations.

“We have implemented technological measures to prevent the [@]Grok account on X globally from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis. This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.” reads the X announcement. “Image creation and the ability to edit images via the [@]Grok account on X are now only available to paid subscribers globally. This adds an extra layer of protection by helping to ensure that individuals who attempt to abuse the [@]Grok account to violate the law or our policies can be held accountable.”

Ireland’s Data Protection Commission’s probe will assess whether X breached key GDPR provisions on lawful data processing, privacy by design, and impact assessments. As X’s lead EU regulator, the DPC said it had already engaged with the company and will now conduct a large-scale investigation into its compliance with fundamental data protection obligations.

“The decision to commence the inquiry was notified to XIUC on Monday 16 February.” Ireland’s DPC  continues. “The purpose of the inquiry is to determine whether XIUC has complied with its obligations under the GDPR, including its obligations under Article 5 (principles of processing), Article 6 (lawfulness of processing), Article 25 (Data Protection by Design and by Default) and Article 35 (requirement to carry out a Data Protection Impact Assessment) with regard to the personal data processed of EU/EEA data subjects.”

The Irish DPC joins a growing list of regulators investigating X, including the European Commission, the UK’s ICO and Ofcom, and authorities in Australia, Canada, India, Indonesia, and Malaysia. France has also been conducting a broad investigation since January, expanding its scope as new concerns arise.

“The DPC has been engaging with XIUC since media reports first emerged a number of weeks ago concerning the alleged ability of X users to prompt the @Grok account on X to generate sexualised images of real people, including children. As the Lead Supervisory Authority for XIUC across the EU/EEA, the DPC has commenced a large-scale inquiry which will examine XIUC’s compliance with some of their fundamental obligations under the GDPR in relation to the matters at hand.” said Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle.

An interesting report published by the nonprofit watch group Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) estimates that Grok generated around 3 million sexualized images in just 11 days after X launched its image-editing feature, an average of about 190 per minute. Among them, roughly 23,000 appeared to depict children, or one every 41 seconds, plus another 9,900 cartoon sexualized images of minors. Researchers found that 29% of identified child images remained publicly accessible, highlighting the scale and speed of the content spread.

[6] Security Affairs - Intellexa’s Predator spyware infected Angolan journalist’s device, Amnesty reports
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 619 kelime]
Amnesty International reports that in May 2024, Intellexa’s Predator spyware infected the iPhone of Teixeira Cândido, an Angolan journalist and press freedom advocate, after he opened a malicious link sent via WhatsApp. This incident highlights how attackers actively target journalists for surveillance.

Predator is a powerful mobile spyware by Intellexa, sold to governments for surveillance. Investigations over five years documented abuses worldwide, despite Intellexa rebranding and shifting its corporate structure. The Angola case marks the first confirmed Predator attack there, showing the spyware remained active through 2025. Amnesty International and partners exposed Intellexa’s operations, but the responsible customers remain unknown.

Since 2022, Angolan journalist Teixeira Cândido faced multiple attacks and break-ins, raising suspicions of surveillance. From April to June 2024, an attacker posing as students sent him WhatsApp messages to gain his trust, eventually sending malicious links. On 4 May 2024, he clicked one link, infecting his iPhone with Intellexa’s Predator spyware. Once installed, the spyware gave attackers full access to his device, including messages, calls, emails, location, camera, microphone, passwords, and other sensitive data, illustrating a targeted and highly invasive surveillance operation.

“Through forensic analysis of the links and associated domain names, Amnesty International’s Security Lab determined with high confidence that all the links sent to Teixeira Cândido to this WhatsApp number were attempts to infect his phone with the Predator spyware. All infection domains matched a network fingerprint used to track Intellexa infection servers.” reads the report published by Amnesty International. “On 4 May 2024, one day after the first Predator infection link was received (Figure 4), Teixeira Cândido appears to have opened the infection link received, which would have resulted in the successful infection of the journalist’s phone with the Predator spyware.

On 4 May 2024, Amnesty International confirmed Predator spyware ran on Teixeira Cândido’s iPhone, executing from the directory /private/var/containers/Bundle/ under the name “iconservicesagent” to impersonate a system process.

His device ran the outdated iOS 16.2, potentially exposing it to known exploits, though Intellexa could also use zero-day vulnerabilities. The spyware remained active less than a day, but attackers sent 11 further malicious WhatsApp links through mid-June 2024. Forensic traces, network activity, and infection domains confirm this attack as Predator.

Amnesty International’s research shows Intellexa’s Predator spyware has targeted Angola since at least early 2023, with the attack on journalist Teixeira Cândido representing just part of broader activity. Predator communicates with spyware servers via domain names, many in Portuguese, revealing a regional focus. Technical analysis linked the domains used against Cândido to Predator, with earlier Angola-linked domains dating back to March 2023. Predator grants total access to devices, making independent audits nearly impossible.

Amnesty considers such spyware fundamentally incompatible with human rights. The Angola attack violates journalists’ rights to privacy and free expression, chilling civil society in a context of growing authoritarianism under President João Lourenço. Amnesty’s inquiries to Intellexa about its role and access to customer systems remain unanswered, raising concerns over the company’s legal and ethical responsibility in these abuses.

“While it remains unclear if Intellexa could access the specific Angolan deployment in 2024, the finding from Intellexa Leaks that the company had potential visibility into active surveillance operations of their customers, including seeing technical information about the targets, raises new legal questions about Intellexa’s role in relation to the spyware and the company’s potential legal or criminal responsibility for unlawful surveillance operations carried out using their products.” concludes the report. “This new case of spyware use against a journalist in Angola makes clear – yet again – that the unchecked sale and use of surveillance technologies continue to facilitate human rights abuses at a global scale. “

Could America turn off Europe’s internet?

That’s one of the questions that Graham and special guest James Ball will be exploring as they discuss tech sovereignty.  Could Gmail, cloud services, and critical infrastructure really become geopolitical leverage? And is anyone actually building a Plan B?

Plus we explore if Meta is quietly plotting to turn its smart glasses into face-recognising surveillance specs? With reports of internal memos suggesting they plan to launch controversial features while everyone’s distracted by political chaos, we ask: is this innovation really wanted by the public… or something far creepier?

All of this, and much more, in episode 455 of the award-winning “Smashing Security” podcast with cybersecurity veteran Graham Cluley, joined this week by journalist and author James Ball.

The dominant narrative has framed the Jan. 3 Caracas power outage during the mission to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro as a “precision cyberattack.” But publicly available information points to a more complicated picture: videos, photographs, and accounts published from Caracas show significant physical damage to at least three Venezuelan substations. Experts who reviewed that material say the observed kinetic damage could, on its own, account for the outages—raising questions about how much of the outage can be confidently attributed to cyber activity alone.

These experts say Operation Absolute Resolve appears to have involved more than a stand-alone “cyber blackout,” despite the framing of many early accounts. In their view, cyber operations may have played some role, but the visible physical attacks alone could plausibly explain the outages—and that kinetic dimension is largely absent from the dominant narrative.

Retired Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery, a former director of operations at US Indo-Pacific Command and now a senior cybersecurity expert at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, described the outage to CyberScoop as part of “a campaign that likely took months to source cyber targets, days to work kinetic targets, and then integrated them into a single campaign plan that took a night.”

How the outage is framed matters because it can shape accountability, influence how governments and utilities prioritize grid security, and affect perceptions of offensive cyber capabilities. If the episode is widely presented as a “cyber-only” success without clear, corroborated evidence, it may encourage outsized conclusions about what cyber tools can accomplish on their own. Over time, that framing can steer policy and spending toward the wrong lessons—emphasizing digital defenses while giving less attention to physical vulnerabilities that may be just as consequential.

Immediate coverage of the operation largely treated cyber as the decisive cause of the outage. Much of that framing traced back to a cryptic line from President Donald Trump  at a post-operation press conference: “It was dark, the lights of Caracas were largely turned off due to a certain expertise [emphasis added] that we have, it was dark, and it was deadly.” (Later Trump suggested that the lights were turned out in Caracas by a “discombobulator.”)

The cyber narrative gained further momentum when Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said at the same press conference that US Cyber Command and Space Command provided “layering effects” for the operation. One widely cited report went further, citing anonymous “people briefed on the matter” to assert that a US cyberattack caused the blackout without offering forensic evidence, technical details, or independent corroboration.

Neither the Pentagon nor Cyber Command has yet to publicly confirm that a cyberattack caused the grid outage. US Cyber Command referred CyberScoop to the Department of War, which did not respond to our queries.

While cyber attribution largely rested on anonymous sourcing and inference, the evidence of physical damage was public, visual, and documented shortly after the attack.

Beginning on Jan. 5, publicly shared videos and photos appeared to show extensive physical damage at substations in Caracas owned by the government’s energy utility company, Corpoelec. The images included apparent bullet impacts, destroyed equipment, blown doors, and oil leaks at the Panamericana 69 kV and Escuela Militar 4.8 kV sites. In Venezuelan government statements, officials attributed the incidents to an attack and said the damage took multiple transmission lines out of service, including the OAM-Vega Caricuao-Panamericana 1 and 2 (69 kV) and Junquito-Panamericana 1 and 2 (69 kV). Electric grid security experts who reviewed the footage told CyberScoop it appeared credible and consistent with the kind of damage that could contribute to localized outages.

Local journalists noted physical attacks on these facilities, as well as a third substation at Fuerte Tiuna, a military installation in Caracas. Videos showing damage to the Fuerte Tiuna substation—some with fires still burning—were uploaded to YouTube on Jan. 12.  AirWars, a not-for-profit group that describes itself as a civilian harm watchdog in conflict-affected nations, confirmed the geolocation of the affected substations and said “heavy weapons and explosive munitions” were used, though it reported no civilian harm.

The Venezuelan government did not respond to CyberScoop’s requests for comment, but it said in a press release that the damage was caused by “missiles.” Several experts with military or electric-sector cybersecurity backgrounds told CyberScoop that, based on what’s visible in the videos, the damage appears consistent with a kinetic attack—most likely carried out via helicopters and planes.

“There were obviously pretty large .50-caliber bullet holes in the walls,” Earl Shockley, president and CEO of INPOWERD, a military veteran and cybersecurity expert who worked for forty years as a power-grid operations engineer, told CyberScoop after viewing one of the videos.

“That’s a kinetic attack,” FDD’s Montgomery told CyberScoop after watching video of the Fuerte Tiuna substation incident.

Across interviews, grid operators, cybersecurity specialists, and military experts independently reached the same conclusion: the visible physical damage alone was enough to cause the outages observed.

Experts note that cyber operations can sometimes produce kinetic effects—as they did in the highly complex US-Israeli operation known as Stuxnet—but they also say that taking down Caracas’s already fragile power grid would not necessarily have required that level of sophistication.

“All of us who are electric sector people, we’ve seen the videos,” Patrick Miller, president and CEO of Ampyx Cyber, told CyberScoop. “We’re all pretty much convinced that would definitely cause an outage. If you’re going to go in and shoot up the substations, why do you need cyber again?”

Miller said that temporarily disrupting the flow of power is a well-understood capability for any nation with the interest to do it–and that it often requires almost no precision or skill. “These are fragile systems, he said.

“This was not a hard cyber target,” Montgomery said. “It’s an easy cyber target. These are older systems that we have worked on before in other countries. They’re not unique. We’re not talking about taking down Idaho National Labs here. We’re talking about taking down a poorly defended, underfunded, under-resourced network.”

Ron Brash, operational technology and industrial control system expert, told CyberScoop, “These energy management systems are probably relatively easy to infiltrate either because they haven’t updated the software or updated what they need to update, and you can exploit the vulnerabilities, or because you buy insider access.” Moreover, he said, “There’s probably so much analog stuff in there from the 1960s.”

Experts generally agree that physical damage likely disabled at least parts of the power grid. But they also think cyber activity may still have played an important supporting role in Operation Absolute Resolve—one that could have enabled or amplified the operation, even if it wouldn’t fully account for where the outages occurred or how long they lasted without accompanying physical damage.

Some experts say that it’s possible the US used cyber capabilities to briefly disrupt power transmission in specific areas—potentially to reduce Venezuelan defenders’ situational awareness as they moved toward Maduro’s compound. “You want to reduce situational awareness, blind the enemy, break their coordination, and enable yourself to maneuver where you need to be. And all of those things just played out with that operation,” Shockley said.

“If we shut down the radars, if we shut down the power grid, they don’t see what’s going on,” he said. “Then we do some kinetic damage to prevent them from bringing the grid back up quickly. That way, we have plenty of time to do what we need to do.”

“A cyberattack is reversible, so it’s temporary,” Montgomery said. “It’s possible that cyber was attempted to take down power stations and equipment before the missiles came in to take down the power stations and equipment,” he added. “You have missiles coming in and taking down power, so nothing works. And before that, you do cyber so that more of your missiles get through. It is kind of a layer to the attack.”

Vice Adm. Heidi Berg, commander of 10th Fleet/Fleet Cyber Command, hinted at such layering at the WEST conference in San Diego earlier this week.

Cyber-based surveillance may also have been used for months in advance, giving the US military visibility into the grid’s weak points and helping inform where kinetic strikes have the greatest effect. “It takes months to identify what the system does, what the software does, do we have access to their older systems,” and so forth, Montgomery said.

“If you monitor that system, you learn where the power flows go, you learn where the single points of failure are, you learn that if this thing blows up, man, I’m in trouble because I can’t get power from this area to that area,” Shockley said.

Trump said at the press briefing that the lights went out in Caracas, and some coverage interpreted that as widespread darkness across large parts of the city. That framing sits uneasily with the idea of narrowly targeted, area-specific disruption. At the same time, social media posts and news accounts from the incident did not indicate that a large portion of Caracas was plunged into darkness.

Valentina Aguana, a Venezuelan digital rights advocate and systems engineer now working in Spain, told CyberScoop that a widespread blackout “was never a thing for my team working in Venezuela. There were very few areas in which the power went down and it came back on in a few minutes,” which you would expect with a pure cyberattack. “All the areas that were left without power were left without power for a couple of hours,” she added, which experts say is consistent with a kinetic attack.

“I haven’t seen any real proof or even correlating proof that the outage was widespread,” Miller said, adding that he has an extensive network of electric system security contacts throughout South America.

Given how quickly and widely videos, press releases, and other confirmation of physical damage to the Venezuelan substations circulated, it remains unclear why so many outlets gave little attention to the kinetic dimension of the outage.

Whatever the source of the omissions, recent reporting on Pentagon computer warfare doctrine has underscored that cyber operations are increasingly designed to shape battlefield conditions rather than function as stand-alone weapons, an approach that aligns with the expert assessments of the role of kinetic attacks in the Caracas operation.

However, continued accounts of what happened in Caracas that treat the sabotage as primarily “cyber” could skew risk assessments and preparedness—potentially leaving substations, transmission lines, and transformers less protected than they should be against the kind of real-world attacks that visible damage suggests are possible.

“This was a very complex thing, and it wasn’t just one thing; it wasn’t just a cyberattack,” Shockley said. “In my industry, we have regulations around how we’re supposed to protect our critical infrastructure, our substations, our power plants, our control centers. Physical security is a big thing that we do. We do physical security inspections, and we make recommendations.”

Adidas investigates third-party data breach after criminals claim they pwned the sportswear giant

'Potential data protection incident' at an 'independent licensing partner,' we're told

Adidas has confirmed it is investigating a third-party breach at one of its partner companies after digital thieves claimed they stole information and technical data from the German sportswear giant.

"We have been made aware of a potential data protection incident at one of our independent licensing partners and distributor for martial arts products," an Adidas spokesperson told The Register. "This is an independent company with its own IT systems."

Adidas declined to answer our questions about when the compromise occurred, or what information the crooks pilfered during the intrusion. The spokesperson added that there's "no indication that the adidas IT infrastructure, our own e-commerce platforms, or any of our consumer data are affected by the incident."

Allegations of an incident at Adidas emerged on February 16, when someone claiming to be the Lapsus$ Group posted on BreachForums (screenshot shared here on Daily Dark Web) that they compromised the sportswear giant’s extranet. According to the crooks, the stolen files – 815,000 rows of information – allegedly include: first and last names, email addresses, passwords, birthdays, company names, and "a lot of technical data."

This latest breach follows a similar, third-party security incident last year affecting the sportswear multinational in May 2025. As we reported at the time, Adidas notified customers that some of their data was stolen after an "unauthorized" person swiped it from a "third-party customer service provider."

Oh, great. Three notorious cybercrime gangs appear to be collaborating

ShinyHunters allegedly drove off with 1.7M CarGurus records

Fraudster hacked hotel system, paid 1 cent for luxury rooms, Spanish cops say

Lapsus$ is a chaotic crew of teens and young people that gained notoriety during a 2021-2022 crime spree. The gang broke into and attempted to extort telecoms giant BT, Nvidia, Microsoft, Samsung, Vodafone, fintech firm Revolut, and Okta, using a mix of phone-based social engineering, SIM swapping, and even paying employees of target organizations for access to credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes.

In March 2022, UK police arrested and then released seven people, aged 16 to 21, for their alleged role in Lapsus$ activities. Police re-arrested and charged two of the teens for their involvement with the cybercrime gang later that month.

More recently, in early August 2025, the crew – or at least some of its members – joined a cybercrime collective with Scattered Spider and ShinyHunters, operating under the name Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters. Two months later, in October 2025, the extortion collab listed Adidas on its leak site, and claimed to have stolen more than 20 million sensitive records back in February 2024. ®

ShinyHunters allegedly drove off with 1.7M CarGurus records

Latest in a rash of grab-and-leak data incidents

CarGurus allegedly suffered a data breach with 1.7 million corporate records stolen, according to a notorious cybercrime crew that posted the online vehicle marketplace on its leak site on Wednesday.

"This is a final warning to reach out by 20 Feb 2026 before we leak along with several annoying (digital) problems that'll come your way," ShinyHunters wrote in its announcement, seen by The Register and shared on social media. The digital crooks claimed the compromised files included personally identifiable information and "other internal corporate data."

CarGurus did not immediately respond to The Register's inquiries. We will update this story when we hear back from the company.

According to ShinyHunters, the breach occurred on February 13, and it was part of the gang’s code stealing spree in which they used voice phishing to obtain single-sign-on codes from users of Okta, Microsoft, and Google services.

The Wednesday posts cap a string of 15 breaches claimed by ShinyHunters and Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters since the beginning of the year, including penetrating two investment advisory firms, Mercer Advisors and Beacon Pointe Advisors, listed on Sunday.

The extortionists set a Wednesday deadline for both companies to negotiate and threatened to leak 5 million records from Mercer and 100,000 from Beacon Pointe. Neither firm has posted a breach notification, and they did not respond to The Register's requests for comment.

At least one of the companies allegedly breached by ShinyHunters and posted to its leak site in February has said the compromise is from an old raid. On Monday, Canada Goose told us that it was "aware that a historical dataset relating to past customer transactions has recently been published online."

The down-filled jacket purveyor, however, declined to say how old the data is or how it was originally stolen.

Blockchain lending firm Figure Technology Solutions was also listed on ShinyHunters' leak site last week, and according to Have I Been Pwned, the criminals stole nearly 1 million customers' records.

A Figure spokesperson told us that "an employee was socially engineered, and that allowed an actor to download a limited number of files through their account."

"We acted quickly to block the activity and retained a forensic firm to investigate what files were affected," the spokesperson's statement, sent via email, continued. "We understand the importance of these matters and are communicating with partners and those impacted as appropriate."

The company also said it is adding "safeguards and training" to boost its digital defenses, and offering free credit monitoring to all affected individuals.

Other recent victims include investment platform Betterment, Match Group (with dating sites Hinge, Match.com, and OkCupid compromised during the intrusion), Panera Bread, and car buying and review sites Carvana and Edmunds.

ShinyHunters previously told The Register that it gained access to Betterment's systems by voice phishing its Okta single sign-on (SSO) codes, and Panera via a Microsoft Entra SSO code. The criminals' spokesperson said the CarMax and Edmunds breaches were from earlier, unrelated intrusions. ®

Fraudster hacked hotel system, paid 1 cent for luxury rooms, Spanish cops say

'First time we have detected a crime using this method,' cops say

Spanish police arrested a hacker who allegedly manipulated a hotel booking website, allowing him to pay one cent for luxury hotel stays. He also raided the mini-bars and didn't settle some of those tabs, police say.

"This cyberattack was specifically designed to alter the payment validation system, and this is the first time we have detected a crime using this method," Spain's National Police told media outlets.

The man, a 20-year-old Spanish national, was arrested while staying at a Madrid hotel with a four-night reservation that carried a €4,000 ($4,716) price tag – unless you hacked the payment system, as this fraudster did.

According to the cops, he stayed at this hotel several times, costing the business more than €20,000 ($23,608) in losses.

Police began investigating the suspect earlier this month after an unnamed online booking website reported suspicious activity. The transactions appeared normal, indicating the man paid the full amount – at first.

Days later, however, when the site transferred the actual amount paid to the hotel, the payment-validation scam surfaced, indicating that the crook paid just one cent for rooms costing €1,000 ($1,179) per night.

Adding insult to injury, police said that the man also consumed mini-bar bottles and sometimes left those bills unpaid, too.

While he may be facing a free stay at a mini-bar free, unluxurious facility for his alleged crimes, we have an idea for his next big vacay, post-prison: an inflatable moon hotel.

The definitely-going-to-happen hotel, slated to open in 2032, requires a deposit of either $250,000 or $1 million. No word on whether GRU Space, the hotel's operators, have received any one cent deposits – yet. ®

Deutsche Bahn back on track after DDoS yanks the brakes

National rail bookings and timetables disrupted for nearly 24 hours

If you wanted to book a train trip in Germany recently, you would have been out of luck. The country's national rail company says that its services were disrupted for hours because of a cyberattack.

Deutsche Bahn, which provides rail services across different subsidiaries, said its website, including booking and timetable systems, were knocked offline by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.

The effects of the attack were first felt on the afternoon of February 17 (1545 UTC), with both its travel app, DB Navigator, and website, bahn.de, experiencing issues affecting countless travelers.

Both of these services were restored as of 1300 UTC on Wednesday, although the company imposed temporary limitations on these systems.

"Our countermeasures were effective in minimizing the impact on our customers," DB said in a blog post.

Despite The Register'squestions, the company did not elaborate on who was behind the attack, whether the perpetrators made contact with DB, or whether customer data was compromised.

"Deutsche Bahn has been and continues to be subject to attacks on its IT systems," the company said in an update posted hours after the initial service restoration. "The current attack is specifically targeted at DB and has occurred in waves.

"The scale of the attack is considerable. Our defense mechanisms are working. We will not comment on speculation regarding the background of the attack. We are in close contact with the federal authorities.

"Our top priority remains the protection of customer data and the availability of our information and booking systems, which are accessed via IT interfaces on other platforms in addition to bahn.de and the DB Navigator app by hundreds of thousands of travelers in Germany."

DDoS attacks tend not to be used by sophisticated cybercriminals. State-backed crews will often opt for malware that leads to destruction or data theft – depending on the motive – or simply exploit vulnerabilities and zero-days for persistent access.

Financially motivated crooks often opt for some kind of extortion, which involves ransomware or data theft, or a combination of the two.

While DDoS attacks can be carried out by cybercriminals of all stripes, they are most often deployed by hacktivists – digital nuisance-makers – and typically only last for a few hours before traffic tails off, as was the case with Deutsche Bahn. ®

[TAM METİN - 880 kelime]
China-linked snoops have been exploiting Dell 0-day since mid-2024, using 'ghost NICs' to avoid detection

Full scale of infections remains 'unknown'

China-linked attackers exploited a maximum-severity hardcoded-credential bug in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines as a zero-day since at least mid-2024. It's all part of a long-running effort to backdoor infected machines for long-term access, according to Google's Mandiant incident response team.

The US government and Google first warned about this campaign last year after detecting Brickstorm backdoors in dozens of critical US networks.

Dell disclosed and patched the critical flaw (CVE-2026-22769) on Tuesday – but noted that miscreants had found and exploited the bug before it issued a fix.

"We have received a report of limited active exploitation of this vulnerability," a Dell spokesperson told The Register. "Customers are urged to immediately implement one of the remediations detailed" in the advisory.

According to Mandiant and the Google Threat Intelligence Group, which also published a security alert on Tuesday about the Dell zero-day, the suspected PRC-linked intruders exploited CVE-2026-22769 to deploy malware including Brickstorm and a separate backdoor tracked as Grimbolt, and in some cases replaced older Brickstorm binaries with Grimbolt, while also creating “Ghost NICs” on virtual machines to enable stealthy network pivoting.

"Analysis of incident response engagements revealed that UNC6201, a suspected PRC-nexus threat cluster, has exploited this flaw since at least mid-2024 to move laterally, maintain persistent access, and deploy malware including Slaystyle, Brickstorm, and a novel backdoor tracked as Grimbolt," said Google threat hunters Peter Ukhanov, Daniel Sislo, Nick Harbour, John Scarbrough, Fernando Tomlinson, Jr, and Rich Reece.

Because the full scale of this campaign is unknown, we recommend that organizations previously targeted by Brickstorm look out for Grimbolt in their environments

When asked about the scope of exploitation, Mandiant Consulting manager Reece, who co-authored the report, said Mandiant knows of "less than a dozen" organizations affected by CVE-2026-22769. "But because the full scale of this campaign is unknown, we recommend that organizations previously targeted by Brickstorm look out for Grimbolt in their environments," he told The Register.

New and improved backdoor

While the earlier versions of the Brickstorm backdoor were written in Go, and later Rust, it appears the attacker replaced these binaries with Grimbolt in September 2025, according to Mandiant.

Grimbolt, written in C#, uses native ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation to translate programming language code into native machine code before the application runs. It's also packed with UPX, an executable packer that compresses the native binary files produced by AOT.

These features make the malware less likely to raise any flags via static analysis, and enhance performance on resource-constrained appliances.

Grimbolt also provides the same remote shell capability and uses the same command and control infrastructure as the earlier Brickstorm malware.

"UNC6201 established Brickstorm and Grimbolt persistence on the Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines by modifying a legitimate shell script named convert_hosts.sh to include the path to the backdoor," the Googlers reported. "This shell script is executed by the appliance at boot time via rc.local."

Plus, they note, the IR team discovered the Dell zero-day while investigating a victim's environment that had been backdoored by Brickstorm and Grimbolt.

Security analysts spotted "multiple web requests" to vulnerable appliances using the username "admin" and directed to the installed Apache Tomcat Manager.

PRC spies Brickstormed their way into critical US networks and remained hidden for years

China remains embedded in US energy networks 'for the purpose of taking it down'

Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines uses Apache Tomcat as its web server, and the security sleuths soon discovered that the attackers had been exploiting a hardcoded password in Apache Tomcat to then deploy a malicious WAR file containing a Slaystyle web shell.

"This is considered critical as an unauthenticated remote attacker with knowledge of the hardcoded credential could potentially exploit this vulnerability leading to unauthorized access to the underlying operating system and root-level persistence."

Additionally, after abusing the bug to exploit the Dell appliances, UNC6201 then created "ghost NICs" – hidden, temporary network ports on existing virtual machines running on an ESXi server – to burrow deeper into victims' VMware virtual infrastructure.

VMware did not immediately respond to The Register's inquiries.

The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and CrowdStrike both previously warned that Chinese attackers were targeting organizations' VMware environments and using Brickstorm for persistent access.

"State-sponsored actors are not just infiltrating networks," CISA's Nick Andersen, executive assistant director for cybersecurity, said in December. "They're embedding themselves to enable long term access, disruption, and potential sabotage." ®

Three new threat groups began targeting critical infrastructure last year, while a well-known Beijing-backed crew - Volt Typhoon - continued to compromise cellular gateways and routers, and then break into US electric, oil, and gas companies in 2025, according to Dragos' annual threat report published on Tuesday.

Dragos specializes in operational technology (OT) security, and as such, its customers include energy, water, manufacturing, transportation, and other critical industries. Unsurprisingly, these are key sectors for Chinese, Russian, and other government-linked cyber operatives to hack for espionage and warfare purposes.

In its yearly cybersecurity report, Dragos said state-sponsored crews haven't let up on their attempts to compromise America's critical infrastructure, with three new OT-focused threat groups joining the fray. This brings the total number worldwide to 26, and of these, 11 were active in 2025.

Additionally, an existing group that Dragos tracks as Voltzite and is "highly correlated" with Volt Typhoon, according to Dragos CEO Robert M. Lee, kept up its intrusion activities last year. This is the Beijing goon squad that the US government has accused of burrowing into critical American networks for years and readying destructive cyberattacks against those targets.

In 2025, Voltzite continued embedding its malware inside strategic American utilities "to maintain long-term persistence," Lee said.

"They [Voltzite] weren't just getting in and getting access - they were getting inside the control loop" system that manages utilities' industrial processes, Lee said in a briefing with reporters, adding that the PRC-backed crew's primary focus is causing future disruption.

Voltzite was embedded in that infrastructure for the purpose of taking it down

"Nothing that they were taking was useful for intellectual property," Lee said. "Everything they were doing and learning was only useful for disrupting or causing destruction at those sites. Voltzite was embedded in that infrastructure for the purpose of taking it down."

In one of these campaigns, the intruders compromised Sierra Wireless AirLink devices and used these to access US pipeline operations' OT networks. Dragos observed Voltzite exfiltrating operational and sensor data, and said the level of access the intruders had to the OT networks allowed them to potentially manipulate control systems. They also accessed engineering workstations and stole configuration files and alarm data, which included information about how to force stop operations.

In another Voltzite-linked campaign, Dragos spotted the crew using the JDY botnet to scan for public-facing Internet Protocol (IP) address ranges and VPN appliances across energy, oil, gas, and defense sectors.

"While no exploitation was confirmed during this phase, Dragos assesses with moderate confidence that the intent appeared to be pre-staging for future intrusions and exfiltration of operational data," according to the report.

New kids on the block

One of the three new groups that Dragos began tracking last year - Sylvanite - serves as Voltzite's initial access broker, responsible for weaponizing vulnerabilities and then handing off this access to Voltzite for deeper OT intrusions.

"Usually that indicates a government team and their national lab, or a government team and a contractor, or two different government agencies," Lee said.

Sylvanite exploits known vulnerabilities in internet-facing products from F5, Ivanti, and SAP to provide Voltzite access into electric power generation, transmission and distribution, water, sewage, and oil and gas organizations across North America, the UK, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.

"They're finding edge-device vulnerabilities - the things that a contractor or remote worker would use to get into operations networks," Lee said. "And within 48 hours of disclosure, they're reverse engineering [vulnerabilities] and hitting those devices."

A second group that emerged during 2025, Azurite, overlaps with China's Flax Typhoon and focuses on gaining long-term access to OT engineering workstations and exfiltrating operational files including network diagrams, alarm data, and process information for downstream capability development.

This group targets manufacturing, defense, automotive, electric power, oil and gas, and government organizations across the US, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region.

Finally, the third new group, Pyroxene, overlaps with activity attributed to Imperial Kitten (aka APT35) - the cyber arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).

Dragos spotted Pyroxene conducting "supply chain-leveraged attacks targeting defense, critical infrastructure, and industrial sectors, with operations expanding from the Middle East into North America and Western Europe," according to the report.

One such intrusion involved collaboration between Pyroxene and a group Dragos tracks as Parisite, which functions as an initial access provider into critical infrastructure orgs.

Pyroxene typically uses recruitment-themed social engineering against targeted individuals, interacting with victims via fake social media profiles before delivering backdoors and other malware. In June 2025, Dragos said the group deployed data-wiping malware against "multiple undisclosed organizations" in Israel around the time of the military conflict between Iran, Israel, and the US.

Don't discount Russia

Of course, China and Iran aren't the only nations targeting critical infrastructure in America and around the globe. Russia also poses a threat to Western water and utilities - along with any nations helping Ukraine in its ongoing war against the Kremlin's occupation.

Dragos does not attribute cyberattacks to any nations. However, earlier this year, it blamed the December 2025 cyberattacks against Poland's power grid on a group it tracks as Electrum. This group overlaps with Russia's GRU-run Sandworm offensive cyber unit - the crew behind the 2022 attack on a Ukrainian power facility and earlier wiper attacks that coincided with Russia's ground invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

In its new report, Dragos said that Kamacite serves as the initial access provider for Electrum, and it detailed a reconnaissance campaign that Kamacite carried out against vulnerable internet-exposed industrial devices in US water, energy, and manufacturing sectors between March and July 2025.

"While Dragos found no evidence of successful exploitation during this period, the scope and precision of the scanning reveal a meaningful evolution in Kamacite's operational posture," the report said. ®

Polish cops nab 47-year-old man in Phobos ransomware raid

Police say seized kit contained logins, passwords, and server IP addresses

Polish police have arrested and charged a man over ties to the Phobos ransomware group following a property raid.

The 47-year-old was cuffed after cops visited his apartment in the Lesser Poland Voivodeship, and looked through his devices, finding various artifacts that investigators believe are linked to cybercrime.

Officials said Tuesday the man's devices contained logins, passwords, credit card numbers, and server IP addresses that could have been used to launch "various attacks, including ransomware."

"After conducting technical investigations, it was discovered that the data contained information that could be used to breach electronic security," police said.

"Furthermore, according to information gathered in the case, the 47-year-old used encrypted messaging to contact the Phobos criminal group, known for conducting ransomware attacks."

According to an image shared by Poland's Central Office for Combating Cybercrime (CBZC), police seized one laptop, four smartphones, an array of payment cards, and a small amount of cannabis.

The man was detained and charged with creating, acquiring, and sharing computer programs used to unlawfully obtain information, including data enabling unauthorized access to information stored in a computer system.

If convicted, he could receive a maximum prison sentence of five years, police said.

The arrest stems from Europol's ongoing Operation Aether, which targets the 8Base ransomware group, believed to be linked to Phobos. It comes almost exactly a year since international law enforcement dismantled the 8Base crew, which was first assembled in 2022.

Bavarian police seized the group's infrastructure used to host its data leak site, while four arrests were made in Thailand.

Before then, Phobos's alleged administrator, Russian national Evgenii Ptitsyn, aged 42 at the time, was arrested in South Korea in 2024 and extradited to the US that same year.

The CBZC said Phobos had recorded more than 1,000 victims during its time on the ransomware scene, including hospitals, schools, nonprofits, and others.

Current estimates peg the total revenue generated by the group at $16 million, securing an average of $54,000 in ransom payments per attack. ®

Canada Goose ruffles feathers over 600K record dump, says leak is old news

Fashion brand latest to succumb to ShinyHunters' tricks

Canada Goose says an advertised breach of 600,000 records is an old raid and there are no signs of a recent compromise.

The down-filled jacket purveyor did not answer questions about how old the data is or how it was originally taken, but told us it relates to past customer purcahses.

"Canada Goose is aware that a historical dataset relating to past customer transactions has recently been published online," a spokesperson said. "At this time, we have no indication of any breach of our own systems. We are currently reviewing the newly released dataset to assess its accuracy and scope, and will take any further steps as may be appropriate."

"To be clear, our review shows no evidence that unmasked financial data was involved. Canada Goose remains committed to protecting customer information."

ShinyHunters posted the company's data for download on February 14 via their leak site. The criminals' advert for the data claimed there were more than 600,000 records, each containing personally identifiable information, as well as payment/financial details.

The Register reviewed a number of the records available online via a JSON file, and ShinyHunters' description of the data appears accurate.

It includes names and other usual PII data points, as well as partial payment information and order details, such as price and delivery address.

A cursory scan suggests affected individuals appear to be based across North America and Europe.

ShinyHunters has had a busy start to 2026: the cybercriminals now have their own data leak site, and have posted a number of high-profile victims this year alone.

Crunchbase and Betterment, two examples of these scalps, were raided as part of the group's targeting of Okta accounts through voice phishing.

Among the other victims are SoundCloud, Match Group, Panera Bread, Harvard University, and wealth management firm Mercer Advisors.

Last year, the criminal crew was linked to attacks on Salesforce, which led to the theft of data belonging to more than 200 of the company's customers, as well as SalesLoft Drift, a Salesforce integration that compromised various Salesforce instances. ®

[18] The Register - Google patches Chrome zero-day as in-the-wild exploits surface

Google patches Chrome zero-day as in-the-wild exploits surface

High-severity CSS flaw let malicious webpages run code inside the sandbox

Google has quietly pushed out an emergency Chrome fix after attackers were caught exploiting the browser's first reported zero-day of 2026.

The flaw, tracked as CVE-2026-2441 and assigned a "high" CVSS score of 8.8, stems from a use-after-free bug in Chrome's CSS handling that could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code inside the browser's sandbox using a specially crafted HTML page. In other words, a dodgy webpage could be all an attacker needs to get malicious code running inside a victim's browser.

Unsurprisingly, Google has rushed out fixes for Chrome with version 145.0.7632.75 for Windows and Mac, and 144.0.7559.75 for Linux, which the Chocolate Factory says will "roll out in the coming days/weeks."

Security researcher Shaheen Fazim reported the flaw on February 11, and Google acknowledged that attackers were already exploiting it just two days later – though it's staying tight-lipped on the specifics. The company has not said whether the attacks were targeted or part of a broader exploitation campaign, only that the vulnerability was being abused before a fix was ready.

"Google is aware that an exploit for CVE-2026-2441 exists in the wild," its security advisory stated.

Google said access to further details about the bug will remain under wraps until most users are patched, and potentially longer if third-party dependencies are involved, a standard move aimed at stopping others from quickly weaponizing the bug.

If this all feels a bit familiar, that's because it is. Google spent much of last year playing Whac-A-Mole with actively exploited Chrome bugs, ultimately patching eight zero-days across 2025.

The fix also lands days after researchers revealed that at least 287 Chrome extensions, with tens of millions of installs between them, were quietly siphoning off users' browsing histories to a long list of outside recipients – a handy reminder that data can leak not just through software flaws but through the sprawling ecosystem bolted onto the browser. ®

Infosec exec sold eight zero-day exploit kits to Russia, says DoJ

PLUS: Fake ransomware group exposed; EC blesses Google's big Wiz deal; Alleged sewage hacker cuffed; And more

Infosec in Brief The former General Manager of defense contractor L3Harris’s cyber subsidiary Trenchant sold eight zero-day exploit kits to Russia, according to a court filing last week.

We first wrote about this case in October 2025, when former Trenchant boss Peter Williams pleaded guilty to two counts of theft of trade secrets – but court records didn’t detail exactly what he stole.

That changed last week when the US Department of Justice published a sentencing memorandum [PDF] that frames Williams’ conduct as a betrayal of his employer and the US government, and the cause of significant harm to US national security.

Williams "made it possible for the Russian Broker to arm its clients with powerful cyber exploits that could be used against any manner of victim, civilian or military around the world," the DoJ said. The broker Williams worked with regularly provided exploits to the Russian government, the DoJ alleged.

Along with the damage he caused to US national security, the DoJ said that Williams' actions also led to the loss of more than $35 million for L3Harris and Trenchant, contributing to the government's call to sentence him to the maximum term allowed under federal guidelines.

The sentencing memo notes that Williams could be incarcerated for up to 108 months (9 years), followed by three years of supervised release. An Australian citizen, Williams has agreed to be deported to his home country after his prison term.

In addition to his time behind bars, the DoJ has also asked the judge to force Williams to pay $35 million in restitution and additional forfeitures of items linked to his crimes.

Ransomware gang turns out to be a couple of kids in a trench coat

A recently emerged ransomware group calling itself 0APT is just a bunch of liars who haven't hacked anyone, cybersecurity researchers have determined.

According to GuidePoint Security, 0APT's claim of having successfully attacked over 200 entities in the course of a single week in late January was a total fabrication, with most claimed victims having ridiculous names like "Metropolis City Municipal." As reports emerged that people thought the group was lying, its data leak site went offline before returning to life a day later with a list of around 15 high-profile multinational victims listed.

GuidePoint says companies on the shortlist also appear to have escaped infection by 0APT – the alleged victims found no evidence of intrusion after the group published their names.

GuidePoint believes there could be two reasons for the scam: Either to fool other cybercriminals into paying it for ransomware-as-a-service tools that don't exist, or to trick organizations into believing they have suffered an attack so they pay ransoms out of fear.

In other words, if 0APT claims to have hit your organization, it probably hasn't – but review your logs just in case.

Payment deadlines extended after actual ransomware attack hits BridgePay

People around the United States are getting a little more time to pay their local government bills following a ransomware attack that's taken payment service provider BridgePay offline for more than a week.

BridgePay provides payment services for local governments and utilities around the country – or it did until knocked offline on February 6 due to a ransomware attack. BridgePay remains offline at the time of publication and warns restoring services could take the better part of another week.

The company said attackers did not compromise payment information, but it still doesn't appear to understand the full extent of the incident. BridgePay said it will provide updates as it learns more.

At least one city, Frisco, Texas, has suspended shutoffs and late fees until the situation is resolved, but not everyone is so fortunate – Palm Bay, Florida's advice on the outage suggests residents ought to hoof it to a city building to pay what's owed.

Polish cyber cops have arrested a suspect believed to have attacked a water and sewage infrastructure operator.

The Central Bureau for Combatting Cybercrime's (CBZC’s) statement on the matter doesn’t say when the attack took place, but does reveal authorities apprehended the suspect in early February.

The CBZC said that the suspect gained unauthorized access to the critical infrastructure provider, logged into an administrator account and stole data. The data later appeared on the dark web.

Polish police claim that their actions in the western Polish city of Poznań enabled them to locate and delete the data and to make the arrest.

EU clears Google's Wiz acquisition

Google's acquisition of cloud security firm Wiz is one step closer to completion, with the EU last week clearing the deal.

The EU said that Google's acquisition of Wiz wouldn't raise competition concerns in Europe, as the likes of AWS and Azure offer their own strong cloud security packages.

"There are several credible competitors that customers could switch to if Google were to bundle Wiz's multi-cloud security platform with its existing products, or in case Wiz's platform no longer worked with clouds other than Google's," the European Commission said. The deal was also cleared by the US Department of Justice in November 2025.

Google previously tried to acquire Wiz in 2024 for $23 billion, but the cloudy security outfit rejected the offer. Google's second offer of $32 billion was enough to change the Wiz team's mind. The deal marks Google's most expensive acquisition to date. ®

[20] CSO Online - Hackers can turn Grok, Copilot into covert command-and-control channels, researchers warn

Hackers can turn Grok, Copilot into covert command-and-control channels, researchers warn

Permissive AI access and limited monitoring could allow malware to hide within trusted enterprise traffic, thereby accelerating adaptive, AI-driven attacks.

Enterprise security teams racing to enable generative AI tools may be overlooking a new risk: attackers can abuse web-based AI assistants such as Grok and Microsoft Copilot to quietly relay malware communications through domains that are often exempt from deeper inspection.

The technique, outlined by Check Point Research (CPR), exploits the web-browsing and URL-fetch capabilities of these platforms to create a bidirectional command-and-control channel that blends into routine AI traffic and requires neither an API key nor an authenticated account.

“Our proposed attack scenario is quite simple: an attacker infects a machine and installs a piece of malware,” CPR said. The malware then communicates with the AI assistant through the web interface, prompting it to fetch content from an attacker-controlled URL and return embedded instructions to the implant.

Because many organizations allow outbound access to AI services by default and apply limited inspection to that traffic, the approach effectively turns trusted AI domains into covert egress infrastructure.

Security analysts said the findings expose a growing blind spot in enterprise AI governance.

“Enterprises that allow unrestricted outbound access to public AI web services without inspection, identity controls, or strong logging are more exposed than many realize,” said Sakshi Grover, senior research manager for IDC Asia Pacific Cybersecurity Services.

“These platforms can effectively function as trusted external endpoints, meaning malicious activity can be concealed within normal network traffic, including routine HTTPS sessions to widely used AI domains,” she added.

Sunil Varkey, a cybersecurity analyst, said the technique echoes past evasion strategies such as steganography and “living off the land” attacks, where adversaries abuse legitimate tools and trusted infrastructure to avoid detection.

CPR said using AI platforms as C2 relays is only one potential abuse case. The same interfaces could be prompted to generate operational commands on demand, from locating files and enumerating systems to producing PowerShell scripts for lateral movement, allowing malware to determine its next steps without direct human control.

In a more advanced scenario, an implant could transmit a brief profile of the infected host and rely on the model to determine how the attack should progress.

A structural shift in detection

The research also points to a broader shift in how malware may evolve as AI becomes embedded in runtime operations rather than just development workflows.

“When AI moves from assisting development to actively guiding malware behavior at runtime, detection can no longer rely solely on static signatures or known infrastructure indicators,” said Krutik Poojara, a cybersecurity practitioner. “Instead of hardcoded logic, you are dealing with adaptive, polymorphic, context-aware behavior that can change without modifying the malware itself.”

Grover said this makes attacks harder to fingerprint, forcing defenders to rely more on behavioral detection and tighter correlation across endpoint, network, identity, and SaaS telemetry.

More significantly, this changes the tempo of defense. If attackers can dynamically adjust commands and execution paths based on the environment they encounter, security teams are no longer responding to a fixed playbook but to a continuously evolving interaction.

“This compresses the window between intrusion and impact and increases the importance of real-time detection, automated response, and tighter feedback loops between threat intelligence and SOC operations,” Grover said.

Security leaders should not respond by blocking AI outright, analysts said, but by applying the same governance discipline used for other high-risk SaaS platforms.

Varkey recommended starting with a comprehensive inventory of all AI tools in use and establishing a clear policy framework for approving and enabling them.

Organizations should also implement AI-specific traffic monitoring and sequence-based detection rules to identify abnormal automation patterns. Other options to consider include rolling out phased awareness programs. “From an architectural standpoint, organizations should also invest in platforms that provide unified visibility across network, cloud, identity, and application layers, enabling security teams to correlate signals and trace activity across domains rather than treating AI usage as isolated web traffic,” Grover said.

Cybersicherheit braucht Reife und keine Checklisten

CISOs wissen: Der Reifegrad ihres Programms ist für die Wirksamkeit der Cybersicherheitsmaßnahmen entscheidend. Dies erfordert eine entsprechende Führung.

Overearth – shutterstock.com

Cybersicherheit wird oft wie ein Spiel behandelt. Unternehmen jagen schnellen Erfolgen hinterher, haken Compliance-Listen ab oder klopfen sich nach einem einzigen erfolgreichen Audit selbst auf die Schulter. Auf dem Papier mag das produktiv aussehen, aber in Wirklichkeit schafft es ein falsches Gefühl der Sicherheit. Der CISO stellt in diesem Bild den Quarterback dar, auf dem die ganze Verantwortung lastet.

Cybersecurity ist jedoch kein Spiel. Sie erfordert eine ausgereifte Führung, langfristiges Denken und klare Verantwortlichkeiten. Alles andere setzt Unternehmen unnötigen Risiken aus. CISOs wissen um diesen Umstand, müssen ihn aber immer wieder in ihren Organisationen zur Sprache bringen.

Zu viele Sicherheitsteams verlassen sich auf Aktivitäten, die wie Fortschritte aussehen und dargestellt werden, aber das Risiko nicht wesentlich verringern. Dinge wie gelegentliche simulierte Phishing-Tests, auffällige neue Sicherheitstools oder die Erfüllung grundlegender Compliance-Anforderungen können ein beruhigendes Gefühl vermitteln. Das Problem ist, dass diese Aktivitäten oft nur die Symptome bekämpfen, nicht aber die Ursachen.

Häufige Beispiele hierfür sind:

Compliance als Errungenschaft statt als Ausgangspunkt betrachten.

Vorfälle als isolierte Ereignisse statt als Indikatoren für systemische Probleme behandeln.

Kennzahlen verfolgen, die gut aussehen, aber nicht die tatsächliche Widerstandsfähigkeit messen.

Glauben, dass Technologie Lücken schließen kann, die durch schwache Governance oder unklare Prozesse entstanden sind.

Das alles ist nur Scheinsicherheit. Es schafft Sichtbarkeit, aber keinen echten Schutz. CISOs sollten Risiken als real und gegenwärtig behandeln. Sie müssen Sicherheitsprogramme entwickeln, die wechselnden Bedrohungen, Personalfluktuation und unerfahrenen Teams standhalten können. Starke Führung ist nicht reaktiv. Sie ist stattdessen bewusst und informiert.

Erfolgreiche CISOs konzentrieren sich auf:

Menschen und Prozesse und priorisieren diese vor technischen Hilfsmitteln

Kulturelle Erwartungen und Verantwortlichkeiten

Klare Zuständigkeiten

Entscheidungsfindung auf der Grundlage von Cyberrisiken und ihren Datenanalysen

Langfristige Resilienz anstatt kurzfristiger Erfolg

Das ist der Unterschied zwischen einem Sicherheitsprogramm, das wirklich funktioniert, und einem, das nur Checklisten abhakt.

Der Wandel vom Spiel zum echten Programm

Der Übergang von einem reaktiven Ansatz zu einem ausgereiften Sicherheitsprogramm beginnt mit einer Änderung der Denkweise. CISOs müssen sich dafür entscheiden, aus dem „Spielmodus“ auszusteigen. Das Ziel besteht bislang darin, mögliche Probleme für ein weiteres Quartal zu vermeiden. Stattdessen müssen sie sich dazu verpflichten, Programme zu entwickeln, die echten Bedrohungen standhalten können.

Zu den wichtigsten Grundsätzen eines solchen Programmes gehören:

Compliance ist die Mindestanforderung, nicht das Endziel.

Sicherheitsmetriken sollten reale Ergebnisse messen, wie die Zeit bis zur Erkennung und Reaktion.

Jeder Vorfall sollte Erkenntnisse liefern, die das Programm verbessern.

Die Planung der Ausfallsicherheit sollte genauso wichtig sein wie die Prävention.

Die Verantwortlichkeit sollte geteilt, sichtbar und messbar sein.

Dies sind die Grundlagen eines ausgereiften Sicherheitsprogramms. Denn die Notwendigkeit wird jeden Tag sichtbar, die Bedrohungslandschaft entwickelt sich mit einer Geschwindigkeit weiter, die jeden Checklistenansatz übertrifft. Hochprofessionelle Angreifer gehen zielgerichtet vor. Sie arbeiten zusammen, automatisieren und innovieren. Sie spielen kein Spiel, verlassen sich nicht auf Checklisten.

Wenn Unternehmen Sicherheit weiterhin als eine Reihe von Aufgaben und nicht als strategische Disziplin behandeln, werden sie ins Hintertreffen geraten. Sicherheitsvorfälle sind keine Zufälle. Sie sind das vorhersehbare Ergebnis einer unreifen Führung.

CISOs müssen daher die Ernsthaftigkeit vorleben, die diese Aufgabe erfordert. Sicherheit ist kein Spiel. Es gibt keine Auszeiten und keine einfachen Neustarts. Was Unternehmen heute aufbauen, wird darüber entscheiden, ob sie den Bedrohungen von morgen standhalten können. Eine Führung mit entsprechender Reife macht den Unterschied zwischen scheinbarer Sicherheit und tatsächlicher Sicherheit aus. (jm)

From in-house CISO to consultant. What you need to know before making the leap

The move from in-house CISO to consultant promises autonomy and impact, but it also forces security leaders to rethink both their skill set and their mindset.

What ultimately crystallized the decision was the thought that his impact didn’t have to stop at the edge of one organization. “I was solving the same problems repeatedly in one company,” he says, “when I could solve them for multiple companies simultaneously, multiplying my impact and helping more businesses grow through pragmatic security leadership.”

In August 2025, Kokhreidze launched his consulting business, Mandos. But he’s careful not to romanticize the move. “It’s important to stay realistic,” he says. Going solo takes time and patience. It means figuring out where you can be most useful. And being willing to stay flexible. “You have to be ready to pivot when you have new ideas, or when things don’t work out,” he says.

Like Kokhreidze, a growing number of CISOs are either moving into consulting roles or seriously considering it. The appeal is easy to see: more flexibility and quicker learning, alongside steady demand for experienced security leaders.

Some of these professionals work as virtual CISOs (vCISOs), advising companies from a distance. Others operate as fractional CISOs, embedding into the organization one or two days a week.

“Consulting gives me more autonomy and control over how I work, while still letting me apply the same strategic approach to improving resilience, governance, and practical security execution,” says Antanas Kedys, founder and CEO at ACyber. He made the shift from an in-house CISO role to consulting in 2022, because he wanted to grow and work across different environments.

When a CISO transitions into consulting, their role changes in ways that aren’t always obvious at first. The new job means sharpening some skills, building entirely new ones and, perhaps hardest of all, learning to let go of control.

“As a CISO, you can mandate; as a consultant, you can only influence,” says Nigel Gibbons, director and senior advisor at NCC Group.

How to prepare to make the leap from security leader to consultant

Long before stepping away from a full-time role, Kokhreidze and other security leaders tried to quietly plan ahead. They tested ideas, built visibility, reconnected with old contacts, and began mapping out who their potential clients might be. The list of potential should be a long one, because few conversations tend to turn into actual work.

“If someone is not asking you right now to consult for them, it can take 12-18 months before you land your first client,” says Carlota Sage. She held a part-time CISO role at a nonprofit before transitioning into vCISO work. Later, she went on to found Pocket CISO, which provides cybersecurity services to early-stage startups and small organizations.

Kokhreidze agrees with her. For a smoother transition, he suggests CISOs line up their first clients while they’re still employed. Otherwise, he says, it can take a long time to build momentum. And the pressure to make it work can quickly turn into panic. In that moment, security professionals may start “underpricing themselves because they need money immediately,” he says. Once rates are set out of desperation, they’re often hard to reset without straining the relationship.

Other CISOs-turned-consultants also emphasize preparation. Kedys, for instance, stresses the need for a go-to-market focus. “Decide who you want to advise (industry, company size, maturity), what problems you’ll solve, and why you’re credible for that,” he says. “The combination of strong soft skills and a clear focus — who, how, and why — is the best starting point for a successful transition.”

Gibbons adds that consulting should grow out of a CISO’s existing experience. He suggests treating that experience as a set of real-world case studies worth talking about, capturing the decisions, the trade-offs, what went wrong and what worked. He also stresses the importance of building relationships beyond the security function, including legal teams, auditors, regulators and investors. “Consulting is ultimately a trust-based profession not a technical one,” he adds.

Skills that carry over into consulting

Many of the skills CISOs honed inside large organizations translate directly to the new consulting job, while others suddenly matter more than they ever did before. In addition to technical skills, it is often the practical ones that prove most valuable.

The ability to prioritize — sharpened over years in a CISO role — becomes especially important in consulting. “It matters more than anything else,” Gibbons argues, because in consulting environments resources are often limited. Consultants are paid not to know everything, but to know what matters most, which risks to tackle first, and which problems can safely wait.

Crisis management is another essential skill. Paired with hands-on knowledge of cybersecurity processes and best practices, it gives former CISOs a real advantage as they move into consulting. Kedys highlights stress management: the ability to stay calm, focused and keep execution moving under pressure, which is just as valuable outside the enterprise as it ever was inside.

But if there’s one translatable skill that everyone talks about, that skill is communication. “All of your security and compliance knowledge is wasted if you cannot communicate to a business audience,” Sage says.

Kokhreidze agrees. Instead of leading with controls, tools or technical details, he focuses on what CTOs and other business leaders actually care about: outcomes. He talks about how security protects revenue, supports resilience, or builds confidence with regulators.

New skills needed in the toolkit

As CISOs move into consulting, they quickly discover they need new skills as well, some of which they may have deliberately avoided in their in-house roles. Chief among them is sales. “Eighty percent of your work is actually selling yourself,” says Kokhreidze. “You are first a business, and CISO second.”

And being a business is time-consuming. Consultants must juggle personal branding, marketing, accounting, and writing. Writing and online presence, in particular, matter because done well, they signal credibility and give current and future clients a sense of how a CISO thinks.

The multiple roles consultants have to play — switching between delivery, sales, marketing and admin while juggling several clients — come with a real mental toll. For many former in-house executives, adjusting to that constant context switching is one of the hardest parts of leaving a structured organization behind. “If you’re running your own consulting firm, context switching can be a struggle,” Sage says.

In time, many consultants learn that discipline matters, and that saying no is part of the job. “You must become comfortable saying no to work that dilutes your positioning or turns you back into an outsourced operator rather than a trusted advisor,” Gibbons says.

Setting the right price

Many CISOs know their value inside an enterprise but translating that value into a consulting price is a different challenge altogether. It requires a shift from thinking like an employee to thinking like a business.

“Skills are not different from a product,” Kedys says. “You just need to find the right product (in this case, the skill) and wrap it in a way a market will be most likely to take it.”

That understanding, he adds, comes from market analysis: observing how executives buy, what they value, and what comparable services cost.

Sage agrees with the idea of analyzing the market but says that CISOs coming from large enterprises and targeting small and mid-sized organizations often need to recalibrate their expectations. What feels like a modest rate to a global organization can be misaligned with the realities of smaller clients, particularly those buying advisory services for the first time.

When thinking about pricing, Kokhreidze took a two-way approach. He looked at the market and assessed his value. Then he set a realistic income goal and worked backwards, factoring in how many clients he could serve well. The result was a pricing model that favored quality over volume, a trade-off he knew the clients he wanted to work with would resonate with.

“B2B companies closing enterprise deals understand that professional security leadership costs far less than losing a single €10M+ contract to failed security reviews,” Kokhreidze says.

When setting prices, one of the most common mistakes is charging for time rather than for the value the consultant brings to the table. Early in his career, Gibbons priced his work by the day instead of by the consequences it helped clients avoid. Over time, he moved toward outcome-based engagements, such as board assurance, regulatory readiness and post-incident recovery, so clients can understand more easily what they’re paying for.

“Clients are buying judgment, not hours,” Gibbons says.

This approach, however, is not universal. Some more traditional organizations remain firmly attached to day rates. In those environments, shifting negotiations can be difficult regardless of the expertise being offered.

Potential mistakes to avoid

Ask experienced consultants what mistakes newcomers tend to make, and the answers tend to be consistent. The biggest mistakes are rarely about security skills. They tend to cluster around mindset, money, and figuring out how to show up in the market.

“The hardest lesson was realizing that being a great CISO doesn’t guarantee clients at all,” Kokhreidze says. “I quickly learned that professional expertise means nothing without strong sales and qualification skills, because you’ll waste months chasing companies that either don’t have the problem you’re trying to solve or aren’t ready to invest in fixing it.”

Gibbons sees a related issue: consultants trying to recreate an in-house role from the outside. They take on operational responsibility, running programs or becoming embedded indefinitely. “That erodes margins and credibility,” he says.

Another common misstep he points to is leading with tools, frameworks or certifications rather than judgment and experience. “Clients do not hire former CISOs for policy templates,” he argues. “They hire them to help make hard decisions with incomplete information.”

Even CISOs who plan carefully before making the leap often discover that the freedom of consulting comes with hidden costs. As Sage puts it, “Most CISOs consulting for the first time underestimate how much time and effort go into just managing your own business.”
