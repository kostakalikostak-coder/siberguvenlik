In yet another software supply chain attack, the open-source, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered coding assistant Cline CLI was updated to stealthily install OpenClaw, a self-hosted autonomous AI agent that has become exceedingly popular in the past few months.

"On February 17, 2026, at 3:26 AM PT, an unauthorized party used a compromised npm publish token to publish an update to Cline CLI on the NPM registry: cline@2.3.0," the maintainers of the Cline package said in an advisory. "The published package contains a modified package.json with an added postinstall script: 'postinstall": "npm install -g openclaw@latest.'"

As a result, this causes OpenClaw to be installed on the developer's machine when Cline version 2.3.0 is installed. Cline said no additional modifications were introduced to the package and there was no malicious behavior observed. However, it noted that the installation of OpenClaw was not authorized or intended.

The supply chain attack affects all users who installed the Cline CLI package published on npm, specifically version 2.3.0, during an approximately eight-hour window between 3:26 a.m. PT and 11:30 a.m. PT on February 17, 2026. The incident does not impact Cline's Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension and JetBrains plugin.

To mitigate the unauthorized publication, Cline maintainers have released version 2.4.0. Version 2.3.0 has since been deprecated and the compromised token has been revoked. Cline also said the npm publishing mechanism has been updated to support OpenID Connect (OIDC) via GitHub Actions.

In a post on X, the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team said it observed a "small but noticeable uptick" in OpenClaw installations on February 17, 2026, as a result of the supply chain compromise of the Cline CLI package. According to StepSecurity, the compromised Cline package was downloaded roughly 4,000 times during the eight-hour stretch.

Users are advised to update to the latest version, check their environment for any unexpected installation of OpenClaw, and remove it if not required.

"Overall impact is considered low, despite high download counts: OpenClaw itself is not malicious, and the installation does not include the installation/start of the Gateway daemon," Endor Labs researcher Henrik Plate said.

"Still, this event emphasizes the need for package maintainers to not only enable trusted publishing, but also disable publication through traditional tokens – and for package users to pay attention to the presence (and sudden absence) of corresponding attestations."

Leveraging Clinejection to Leak Publication Secrets

While it's currently not clear who is behind the breach of the npm package and what their end goals were, it comes after security researcher Adnan Khan discovered that attackers could steal the repository's authentication tokens through prompt injection by taking advantage of the fact that it is configured to automatically triage any incoming issue raised on GitHub.

"When a new issue is opened, the workflow spins up Claude with access to the repository and a broad set of tools to analyze and respond to the issue," Khan explained. "The intent: automate first-response to reduce maintainer burden."

But a misconfiguration in the workflow meant that it gave Claude excessive permissions to achieve arbitrary code execution within the default branch. This aspect, combined with a prompt injection embedded within the GitHub issue title, could be exploited by an attacker with a GitHub account to trick the AI agent into running arbitrary commands and compromise production releases.

This shortcoming, which builds upon PromptPwnd, has been codenamed Clinejection. It was introduced in a source code commit made on December 21, 2025. The attack chain is outlined below -

Prompt Claude to run arbitrary code in issue triage workflow

Evict legitimate cache entries by filling the cache with more than 10GB of junk data, triggering GitHub's Least Recently Used (LRU) cache eviction policy

Set poisoned cache entries matching the nightly release workflow's cache keys

Wait for the nightly publish to run at around 2 a.m. UTC and trigger on the poisoned cache entry

"This would allow an attacker to obtain code execution in the nightly workflow and steal the publication secrets," Khan noted. "If a threat actor were to obtain the production publish tokens, the result would be a devastating supply chain attack."

"A malicious update pushed through compromised publication credentials would execute in the context of every developer who has the extension installed and set to update automatically."

In other words, the attack sequence employs GitHub Actions cache poisoning to pivot from the triage workflow to a highly privileged workflow, such as the Publish Nightly Release and Publish NPM Nightly workflows, and steal the nightly publication credentials, which have the same access as those used for production releases.

As it turns out, this is exactly what happened, with the unknown threat actor weaponizing an active npm publish token (referred to as NPM_RELEASE_TOKEN or NPM_TOKEN) to authenticate with the Node.js registry and publish Cline version 2.3.0.

"We have been talking about AI supply chain security in theoretical terms for too long, and this week it became an operational reality," Chris Hughes, VP of Security Strategy at Zenity, said in a statement shared with The Hacker News. "When a single issue title can influence an automated build pipeline and affect a published release, the risk is no longer theoretical. The industry needs to start recognizing AI agents as privileged actors that require governance."

[2] The Hacker News - ClickFix Campaign Abuses Compromised Sites to Deploy MIMICRAT Malware

[TAM METİN - 392 kelime]
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a new ClickFix campaign that abuses compromised legitimate sites to deliver a previously undocumented remote access trojan (RAT) called MIMICRAT (aka AstarionRAT).

"The campaign demonstrates a high level of operational sophistication: compromised sites spanning multiple industries and geographies serve as delivery infrastructure, a multi-stage PowerShell chain performs ETW and AMSI bypass before dropping a Lua-scripted shellcode loader, and the final implant communicates over HTTPS on port 443 using HTTP profiles that resemble legitimate web analytics traffic," Elastic Security Labs said in a Friday report.

According to the enterprise search and cybersecurity company, MIMICRAT is a custom C++ RAT with support for Windows token impersonation, SOCKS5 tunneling, and a set of 22 commands for comprehensive post-exploitation capabilities. The campaign was discovered earlier this month.

It's also assessed to share tactical and infrastructural overlaps with another ClickFix campaign documented by Huntress that leads to the deployment of the Matanbuchus 3.0 loader, which then serves as a conduit for the same RAT. The end goal of the attack is suspected to be ransomware deployment or data exfiltration.

In the infection sequence highlighted by Elastic, the entry point is bincheck[.]io, a legitimate Bank Identification Number (BIN) validation service that was breached to inject malicious JavaScript code that's responsible for loading an externally hosted PHP script. The PHP script then proceeds to deliver the ClickFix lure by displaying a fake Cloudflare verification page and instructing the victim to copy and paste a command into the Windows Run dialog to address the issue.

This, in turn, leads to the execution of a PowerShell command, which then contacts a command-and-control (C2) server to fetch a second-stage PowerShell script that patches Windows event logging (ETW) and antivirus scanning (AMSI) before dropping a Lua-based loader. In the final stage, the Lua script decrypts and executes in memory shellcode that delivers MIMICRAT.

The Trojan uses HTTPS for communicating with the C2 server, allowing it to accept two dozen commands for process and file system control, interactive shell access, token manipulation, shellcode injection, and SOCKS proxy tunneling.

"The campaign supports 17 languages, with the lure content dynamically localized based on the victim's browser language settings to broaden its effective reach," security researcher Salim Bitam said. "Identified victims span multiple geographies, including a USA-based university and multiple Chinese-speaking users documented in public forum discussions, suggesting broad opportunistic targeting."

[3] BleepingComputer - Why the shift left dream has become a nightmare for security and developers

Written by Ivan Milenkovic, Vice President Risk Technology EMEA, Qualys

For the better part of the last decade,we have engaged in a comfortable fiction around security and development. If we could only "shift left" and get developers to take a modicum more responsibility for security alongside their coding, testing and infrastructure deployment, the digital world would become a safer, faster and cheaper place. Instead, the fundamental conflict between speed and security has got worse.

Why did this fail? Developers are under crushing pressure. The classic triangle of project management - Fast, Good, Cheap; pick two - has been smashed to pieces.

Businesses demand fast, good, cheap and secure. When push comes to shove, "fast" always wins. At the same time, we pushed too much cognitive load onto developers who were already drowning.

When they choose to use public container images to speed up development, they are trying to meet their goals, but they are also open to potential risk. So how can we understand what the real problem is, and then work to solve that?

Business demands beat security recommendations

There is a pervasive narrative in the security industry that developers are lazy or careless. This is absolutely not true. Developers are not lazy; they are overloaded, pragmatic professionals reacting to the incentives placed before them. If their bonus depends on shipping features by Friday and the security scan takes four hours to run and blocks the build, they will find a way around the scan.

Businesses demand results faster and faster, which has created an environment where security protocols are seen as a barrier to productivity rather than an integral part of engineering. When security tools are noisy, slow, and disconnected from the workflow, they are a barrier.

However, the result of this is that organisations have lost control of what is actually running in their environments. We have pipelines that deploy code automatically, infrastructure that scales up and down without human intervention, and AI agents that can now write and execute their own scripts.

Into this high-speed, automated chaos, we treat public registries like curated libraries, assuming that because an image is on Docker Hub, it must be safe. But pulling a container from a public registry like Docker Hub is a trust decision.

The likes of Docker, Amazon, Google and Microsoft all operate public container registries, so there is a natural assumption that they are safe.

This trust is misplaced. By the time that container image makes it to the deployment pipeline, it is already a trusted artifact, baked into the application.

The 2026 Forrester Wave™ for Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPP) provides objective analysis around cloud security.

Find out why Qualys is one of the leaders in the market today.

The 34,000 Image Reality Check

Qualys Threat Research Unit (TRU) recently conducted an exhaustive analysis of over 34,000 container images pulled from public repositories to see what is really going on beneath the manifest.

Of that total, around 2,500 images - approximately 7.3 percent of the sample - were malicious. Of the malicious images, 70 percent contained cryptomining software.

On top of this, 42 percent of images contained more than five secrets that could be used to get access to other resources or accounts. This includes valuable items like AWS access keys, GitHub API tokens, and database credentials baked directly into the image layers.

In our analysis, the biggest issues around malicious containers are still very simple. Typosquatting is one of the most common methods that attackers use to get their malicious containers downloaded. The standard advice to "check the spelling" is essential, yes, but it is also a low-energy response to a high-stakes problem.

Telling a developer to "be more careful" is not a security strategy. While public registries are handy for speed, we should not be letting developers pull from public registries at all.

In a mature environment, every external image should be proxied through an internal artifact repository that acts as a quarantine zone. Yet that need for speed is not going to go away. Instead, we have to work on how to help developers move faster while keeping security in place.

This does mean more work for the infrastructure team, but that work should enable developers to move ahead faster and with less risk.

The logic is that it is cheaper to fix a bug during design or coding than in production. Therefore, moving security earlier in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) should reduce risks later. While this makes sense in theory, it asks developers to scan their own code, check their own dependencies, and manage their own infrastructure.

In reality, we just shifted the pain onward. It asks developers to manage vulnerabilities, configuration hardening, secret detection, compliance auditing, and so on. At the same time, those developers are measured primarily on feature velocity.

"Shift left" was supposed to make security collaborative. Instead, it simply moved the problem into every developer’s IDE. To fix this problem, we have to make security within infrastructure the default, rather than by design.

This involves real collaboration between developers and security - developers have to understand what they want to achieve and what will be required of what they build, while security will have to work around those requirements so they can be delivered securely. Both teams are responsible, but they both have to work at the speed that the business needs.

In practice, we can create a "golden path" for developers. If they use the standard templates, the pre-approved base images, and the official CI pipelines, security is free. If they want to go "off-road" and build something custom, then they have to do the additional work of security reviews and manual configurations.

This is also something that should be flagged back to the business from the start, so security and development present a united front around what the cost is.

Taking this approach incentivises secure deployment by making it the path of least resistance. It moves the responsibility down the stack to the infrastructure layer, managed by a specialised Platform Engineering team. And if something different is needed, that work can be done collaboratively to ensure it is right first time, rather than leading to more issues that need to be remediated.

For example, instead of asking a developer to please enable versioning on a specific S3 bucket, the platform team writes a policy using Terraform modules, Crossplane compositions, or Open Policy Agent that simply doesn't allow a bucket to exist without versioning. The developer literally cannot make the mistake.

The platform corrects it automatically or rejects the request. Similarly, developers shouldn't have to remember container scanning in their workflows, the CI pipeline should do it automatically. The admission controller should reject non-compliant images before they ever hit a cluster. The developer doesn't need to know how the scan works, only that if they try to deploy a critical vulnerability, the door will be locked.

"Shift down" also means automating the fix. For instance if a vulnerability is found in a base image, the platform should automatically generate a Pull Request to upgrade it. If a runtime security tool detects a container behaving badly (e.g., spawning a shell for persistence), it shouldn't just send an alert. It should kill the pod and isolate the node autonomously.

Rather than sticking with existing ways of running across security and development, we have to react to what is happening. This can mean we fundamentally change how we operate across teams.

If we continue with the "shift left" mentality of piling cognitive load onto developers, we will fail. We will burn them out, and they will bypass our controls simply so they can get what needs to be done for the business.

Instead, security has to be proactive around how to implement and support the right platforms for the business, so they can be made secure automatically.

[4] BleepingComputer - PayPal discloses data breach that exposed user info for 6 months
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 506 kelime]
PayPal is notifying customers of a data breach after a software error in a loan application exposed their sensitive personal information, including Social Security numbers, for nearly 6 months last year.

The incident affected the PayPal Working Capital (PPWC) loan app, which provides small businesses with quick access to financing.

PayPal discovered the breach on December 12, 2025, and determined that customers' names, email addresses, phone numbers, business addresses, Social Security numbers, and dates of birth had been exposed since July 1, 2025.

The financial technology company said it has reversed the code change that caused the incident, blocking attackers' access to the data one day after discovering the breach.

"On December 12, 2025, PayPal identified that due to an error in its PayPal Working Capital ("PPWC") loan application, the PII of a small number of customers was exposed to unauthorized individuals during the timeframe of July 1, 2025 to December 13, 2025," PayPal said in breach notification letters sent to affected users.

"PayPal has since rolled back the code change responsible for this error, which potentially exposed the PII. We have not delayed this notification as a result of any law enforcement investigation."

PayPal also detected unauthorized transactions on the accounts of a small number of customers as a direct result of the incident and has issued refunds to those affected.

The company now offers affected users two years of free three-bureau credit monitoring and identity restoration services through Equifax, which require enrollment by June 30, 2026.

Affected customers are also advised to monitor their credit reports and their account activity for suspicious transactions. PayPal reminded users that it never requests account passwords, one-time codes, or other authentication credentials via phone, text, or email, a common tactic used in phishing attacks that often follow data breach disclosures.

While PayPal has yet to disclose how many customers were affected, it has reset passwords for all impacted accounts and said that users will be prompted to create new credentials upon their next login if they have not already done so.

BleepingComputer reached out to a PayPal spokesperson with questions about the incident, but a response was not immediately available.

In January 2023, PayPal notified customers of another data breach after a large-scale credential stuffing attack compromised 35,000 accounts between December 6 and December 8, 2022.

Two years later, in January 2025, New York State announced a $2,000,000 settlement with PayPal over charges that it failed to comply with the state's cybersecurity regulations, leading to the 2022 data breach.

[5] Security Affairs - North Korean IT worker scam nets Ukrainian five-year sentence in the U.S.

[TAM METİN - 639 kelime]
Oleksandr “Alexander” Didenko, a 29-year-old Ukrainian national, has been sentenced to five years in a U.S. prison for supporting North Korea’s fraudulent IT worker scheme. Didenko admitted stealing U.S. identities and selling them to North Korean IT workers, enabling them to secure jobs at 40 American companies. The salaries were funneled back to Pyongyang. He was arrested in Poland in 2024 and later extradited.

“Oleksandr Didenko, 29, of Kyiv, Ukraine, was sentenced today in U.S. District Court to 60 months in prison in connection with a years-long scheme that stole the identities of U.S. citizens and sold them to North Korean workers so they could fraudulently gain employment at 40 U.S. companies, announced U.S. Attorney Jeanine Ferris Pirro.” reads the press release published by  “Didenko, aka “Alexander Didenko,” pleaded guilty Nov. 10, 2025, before Judge Randolph D. Moss to wire fraud conspiracy and aggravated identity theft.”

Didenko will forfeit over $1.4M, including $181K in cash and crypto, serve 12 months supervised release, and pay $46,547 in restitution.

Didenko has also been ordered to serve 12 months of supervised release and to pay $46,547.28 in restitution. Last year, Didenko also agreed to forfeit more than $1.4 million, which includes about $181,438 in U.S. dollars and cryptocurrency seized from him and his co-conspirators.

Didenko allegedly ran a multi-year scheme creating accounts on U.S.-based freelance IT job platforms and money service transmitters using false identities, including those of U.S. persons. Then the man sold these accounts to overseas IT workers. He is the administrator of a website called upworksell.com, which was used to advertise these services along with credit card and SIM card rentals. The investigation revealed that Didenko managed about 871 proxy identities and provided accounts for three freelance IT platforms and three U.S.-based money service transmitters. He facilitated at least three U.S.-based laptop farms, hosting around 79 computers, and received or sent $920,000 since July 2018. The man admitted to assisting North Korean IT workers and was interconnected with other cells within the DPRK IT worker network.

“Defendant Didenko’s scheme funneled money from Americans and U.S. businesses, into the coffers of North Korea, a hostile regime. Today, North Korea is not only a threat to the homeland from afar, it is an enemy within. By using stolen and fraudulent identities, North Korean actors are infiltrating American companies, stealing information, licensing, and data that is harmful to any business. But more than that, money paid to these so-called employees goes directly to munitions programs in North Korea,” said U.S. Attorney Pirro. “We should be holding accountable to the fullest extent of the law the individuals, like Didenko, who are knowingly assisting North Koreans so that they can amass more weapons to harm the United States and peace in our world. This is not just a financial crime; it is a crime against national security.”

In May 2024, the Justice Department unsealed charges against an Arizona woman, a Ukrainian man, and three unidentified foreign nationals accused of aiding overseas IT workers, pretending to be U.S. citizens, to infiltrate hundreds of firms in remote IT positions. North Korea used this scheme to dispatch thousands of skilled IT workers globally, using stolen U.S. identities to infiltrate companies and raise revenue. The schemes defrauded over 300 U.S. companies, utilizing U.S. payment platforms, online job sites, and proxy computers. According to the DoJ, this is the largest scheme of this kind ever charged by US authorities.

The operations coordinated by the North Korean government took place between October 2020 and October 2023. Intelligence experts speculate the campaign was aimed at financing the government’s illicit nuclear program.

The defendant Christina Marie Chapman was arrested in May in Litchfield Park, Arizona, while Oleksandr Didenko was arrested in Poland a few days before.

[6] The Register - Ukrainian gets five years for helping North Koreans secure US tech jobs

Ukrainian gets five years for helping North Koreans secure US tech jobs

Polish arrest leads to extradition and federal prison sentence

Ukrainian national Oleksandr Didenko will spend the next five years behind bars in the US for his involvement in helping North Korean IT workers secure fraudulent employment.

The 29-year-old played a role in supporting individuals working for a hostile regime to get contracts in the US.

In November 2025, Didenko pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, charges related to his website Upworksell.com, which allowed the North Korean techies assume identities stolen from US citizens and use them to secure employment.

North Korea's IT worker scheme has been running for years. It sees skilled workers illegally gain access to US jobs and salaries, which are used to fund Pyongyang's military.

Workers rely on being able to trick US companies into believing they are citizens by using resources such as identity providers like Didenko and laptop farms, which the Ukrainian also funded.

Laptop farms are exactly as they sound. Individuals in the US are paid to operate a series of laptops or PCs to which North Korean workers remotely connect and use to carry out their US job duties.

Using a laptop farm allows them to connect to company networks, seemingly as if from a US residence instead of a North Korean IP address. Government sanctions prevent North Koreans from working for US companies.

According to prosecutors, Didenko ran Upworksell between 2021 and May 2024, when the Justice Department seized the domain, diverting all traffic to servers controlled by the FBI. Polish police arrested him later that year, and he was extradited on December 31, 2024.

Didenko operated as many as 871 proxy identities during this time, official suspect, and he paid people in at least three residences across California, Tennessee, and Virginia to run laptop farms. He also helped these workers manage their salary payments through money services businesses so that they didn't have to open a US bank account.

Through Didenko's scheme, North Korean IT workers were able to get hundreds of thousands of dollars in fraudulent salary payments. The Justice Department said much of this was falsely reported to the authorities in the names of those whose identities were stolen.

Didenko agreed to forfeit more than $1.4 million in criminal proceeds as part of his sentence, which will be followed by 12 months of supervised release. He will also pay $46,547.28 in restitution to victims.

"Defendant Didenko's scheme funneled money from Americans and US businesses, into the coffers of North Korea, a hostile regime," said US attorney Jeanine Ferris Pirro, announcing the sentencing.

"Today, North Korea is not only a threat to the homeland from afar, it is an enemy within.

[7] CSO Online - KI und Komplexität als Brandbeschleuniger für Cyberkriminelle

KI und Komplexität als Brandbeschleuniger für Cyberkriminelle

Hackerangriffe werden massiv durch KI beschleunigt. Die Zeit bis zur Ausnutzung ist laut einer Studie auf 72 Minuten gesunken.

andrey_l – shutterstock.com

Der Einzug von KI hat den benötigten Zeitaufwand für Cyberattacken massiv verkürzt, so dass menschliche Verteidiger nicht mehr mithalten können. So lautet das vielleicht wenig überraschende Ergebnis des 2026 Global Incident Response Report von Palo Alto Networks. Für die Studie hat das Unit-42-Forscherteam 750 Vorfälle in 50 Ländern analysiert.

Bei den schnellsten der analysierten Angriffe gelangten die Täter innerhalb von 72 Minuten vom ersten Zugriff bis zur Datenexfiltration – verglichen mit fast fünf Stunden im Jahr 2024. „Dies lässt sich zunehmend durch die Fähigkeit der KI erklären, die benötigten Zeiträume für die Erkennung von Schwachstellen, Phishing und Ausführung zu verkürzen“, heißt es im Forschungsbericht.

Grundlegende Sicherheitsmängel begünstigen Cyberangriffe

Bei genauerer Betrachtung der Studienergebnisse lauert die Gefahr jedoch wo anders: Was Unternehmen wirklich schadet, sind nicht so sehr schnell agierende Angreifer oder die KI, sondern grundlegende Mängel wie schwache Authentifizierung, mangelnde Echtzeit-Transparenz und Fehlkonfigurationen aufgrund einer komplexen Vielzahl von Sicherheitssystemen.

Theoretisch sind all diese Probleme behebbar. Die Autoren der Analyse stellen fest: „Trotz der Geschwindigkeit und Automatisierung, die wir beobachten, beginnen die meisten Vorfälle mit nichts radikal Neuem: Es sind Lücken, die immer wieder auftauchen. In vielen Fällen verließen sich die Angreifer nicht auf einen ausgeklügelten Exploit, sondern auf eine übersehene Schwachstelle.“

Identitätskonflikt und Komplexität

Ein wiederkehrendes Thema ist zudem der Konflikt, den viele Unternehmen mit Identität und Trust haben. Das Forscherteam stellte fest, dass dies bei 90 Prozent der untersuchten Vorfälle eine Rolle spielte. Zu den Taktiken der Angreifer gehörten Social Engineering (33 Prozent), identitätsbasiertes Phishing (22 Prozent), Missbrauch von Anmeldedaten und Brute-Force-Angriffe (21 Prozent) sowie Insider-Bedrohungen (acht Prozent).

Bei 99 Prozent der 680.000 von Palo Alto Networks analysierten Cloud-Benutzer, Rollen und Dienste verfügten zu viele Konten über übermäßige Berechtigungen. . Dazu zählten auch einige, die seit 60 Tagen oder länger nicht mehr genutzt wurden. Da Unternehmen immer mehr Cloud-, SaaS- und KI-Anwendungen hinzufügen, entsteht den Security-Spezialisten zufolge eine Angriffsfläche für Identitäten, die sich schneller ausweitet, als die zugrunde liegenden Probleme behoben werden können. .

Diese Identitäten beziehen sich dabei zunehmend auf Maschinenidentitäten (Dienstkonten, Automatisierungsrollen, API-Schlüssel, KI-Agenten), Schattenidentitäten (nicht genehmigte Konten, Entwicklerumgebungen und Dritte) und Identitäts-„Silos“ (lokale AD plus mehrere Cloud-Identitätsanbieter).

„Selten bleibt ein Angriff auf eine einzige Umgebung beschränkt. Stattdessen beobachten wir koordinierte Aktivitäten über Endpunkte, Netzwerke, Cloud, SaaS und Identitäten hinweg, sodass Verteidiger gezwungen sind, alle gleichzeitig zu überwachen“, so die Analysten.

Lieferketten sind ein weiterer gefährdeter Bereich. In 23 Prozent der Vorfälle konnten Angreifer SaaS-Anwendungen von Drittanbietern ausnutzen und dabei herkömmliche Sicherheitskontrollen umgehen. „Wenn ein vorgelagerter Anbieter eine Kompromittierung oder einen Ausfall meldete, mussten Kunden oft innehalten und sich eine grundlegende Frage stellen: Sind wir betroffen? In vielen Fällen hatten sie nur begrenzte Einblicke in ihre eigene Gefährdung“, berichten die Studienautoren.

Die Antwort von Unit 42 auf diesen endlosen Kreislauf, in dem Angreifer den Verteidigern immer einen Schritt voraus sind, ist ein Paradigmenwechsel: Die Cybersicherheit ist mittlerweile so spezialisiert, dass die Lösung darin besteht, einen von Grund auf neu entwickelten Managed Service zu nutzen, um realen statt abstrakten Bedrohungen entgegenzuwirken.

Vor diesem Hintergrund hat Palo Alto Networks einen neuen SOC-Dienst eingeführt: Unit 42 Managed Extended Security Intelligence and Automation Management (XSIAM) 2.0. Damit hat das Unternehmen nach eigenen Angaben sein XSIAM 1.0 um vollständiges Onboarding, Bedrohungssuche und -reaktion sowie die Modellierung von Angriffsmustern erweitert, die schneller als bei einem herkömmlichen SOC erfolgen.

Doch ist das wirklich überzeugend? CISOs haben diese Botschaft schon oft gehört: Das Alte funktioniert nicht mehr, also investieren Sie in etwas Neues. Und es gibt immer ein altes System oder einen alten Dienst, der durch ein glänzendes, neues ersetzt werden muss.

Erschwerend kommt hinzu, dass die Idee immer fortschrittlicherer SOCs möglicherweise kein Allheilmittel ist. Einige Experten sind der Meinung, dass SOCs selbst letztendlich denselben Problemen wie Fachkräftemangel und Budgetbeschränkungen ausgesetzt sein können wie herkömmliche IT-Abteilungen.

Wie Palo Alto Networks es ausdrückt: „Die meisten SOCs sind nicht für die Geschwindigkeit der heutigen Angriffe ausgelegt.“ Das bedeutet: Weg mit alten Tools wie traditionellen SIEMs und SOAR, die lediglich Warnmeldungen generieren; das moderne, KI-gestützte SOC sollte „mit Maschinengeschwindigkeit“ darauf reagieren.
