A 39-year-old Australian national who was previously employed at U.S. defense contractor L3Harris has been sentenced to a little over seven years in prison for selling eight zero-day exploits to Russian exploit broker Operation Zero in exchange for millions of dollars.

Peter Williams pleaded guilty to two counts of theft of trade secrets in October 2025. In addition to the jail term, Williams has been ordered to serve three years of supervised release with special conditions, as well as forfeit illicit proceeds, including properties, clothing, jewelry, and luxury watches, purchased from the cryptocurrency payments he received in return for selling the exploits.

The case's connection to Operation Zero was disclosed by cybersecurity journalist Kim Zetter late last year. The nature of the exploits are presently unclear. But a sentencing memorandum published earlier this month revealed that the tools could have been "used against any manner of victim, civilian or military around the world, and engage in all manner of crime from cyber fraud, theft, and ransomware, to state directed spying and offensive cyber operations against military targets."

"Williams exploited his senior role at a U.S. defense contractor to enrich himself at the expense of the United States and his employer," said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg. "The tools he compromised were intended to protect this Nation; instead, he auctioned them off to a Russian bidder."

According to U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro for the District of Columbia, Williams sold the trade secrets for up to $4 million in cryptocurrency. The exploit tools could have allowed Russia to access millions of digital devices, Pirro added.

The theft of eight cyber-exploit components took place over a period of three years between 2022 and 2025. The zero-day exploits are designed to be sold exclusively to the U.S. government and select allies. The actions are estimated to have incurred L3Harris $35 million in financial losses.

The U.S. State Department, in tandem, announced the designations of Operation Zero (aka Matrix LLC), along with Sergey Sergeyevich Zelenyuk and Special Technology Services LLC FZ (STS), under the Protecting American Intellectual Property Act (PAIPA) in connection with the trade secret theft.

Zelenyuk is a Russian national and the director and owner of Operation Zero. He also established STS in the U.A.E. to conduct business with various countries in Asia and the Middle East and likely get around U.S. sanctions imposed on Russian bank accounts.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) also sanctioned Zelenyuk, Operation Zero, STS, and four other associated individuals and entities for acquiring and distributing cyber tools harmful to U.S. national security. According to the Treasury, Operation Zero is said to have sold the tools acquired from Williams to at least one unauthorized user.

Operation Zero has offered up to $4 million in bounties for Telegram exploits and $20 million for tools that could be used to break into Android and iPhone devices. The exploit broker is believed to have engaged in efforts to recruit hackers to support its activities and develop business relationships with foreign intelligence agencies through social media. It's been active since at least 2021.

"Zelenyuk and Operation Zero have stated that they will only sell the exploits they acquire to customers from non-NATO countries. Zelenyuk, through Operation Zero, has sought to sell exploits to foreign intelligence agencies," the Treasury Department said.

"Zelenyuk and Operation Zero have also sought to develop other cyber intelligence systems, including spyware and methods to extract personal identifying information and other sensitive data uploaded by users of artificial intelligence applications like large language models."

The names of the other sanctioned individuals and entities are listed below -

Marina Evgenyevna Vasanovich, Zelenyuk's assistant

Azizjon Makhmudovich Mamashoyev and Oleg Vyacheslavovich Kucherov, for having had work relationships with Operation Zero (Kucherov is also suspected of being a member of the TrickBot cybercrime gang)

Advance Security Solutions, an exploit brokerage firm created by Mamashoyev that offers bounties for exploits for U.S.-built software

"Peter Williams stole a U.S. defense contractor's trade secrets about highly sensitive cyber capabilities and sold them to a broker whose clients include the Russian government, putting our national security and countless potential victims at risk," said Assistant Director Roman Rozhavsky of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Counterintelligence and Espionage Division.

"Let this be a clear warning to all who consider placing greed over country: if you betray your position of trust and sell sensitive American technology to our foreign adversaries, the FBI will not rest until you're brought to justice."

[TAM METİN - 215 kelime]
SolarWinds has released updates to address four critical security flaws in its Serv-U file transfer software that, if successfully exploited, could result in remote code execution.

The vulnerabilities, all rated 9.1 on the CVSS scoring system, are listed below -

CVE-2025-40538 - A broken access control vulnerability that allows an attacker to create a system admin user and execute arbitrary code as root via domain admin or group admin privileges.

CVE-2025-40539 - A type confusion vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary native code as root.

CVE-2025-40540 - A type confusion vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary native code as root.

CVE-2025-40541 - An insecure direct object reference (IDOR) vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute native code as root.

SolarWinds noted that the vulnerabilities require administrative privileges for successful exploitation. It also said that they carry a medium security risk on Windows deployments as the services "frequently run under less-privileged service accounts by default."

The four shortcomings affect SolarWinds Serv-U version 15.5. They have been addressed in SolarWinds Serv-U version 15.5.4.

While SolarWinds makes no mention of the security flaws being exploited in the wild, prior vulnerabilities in the software (CVE-2021-35211, CVE-2021-35247, and CVE-2024-28995) have been exploited by malicious actors, including by a China-based hacking group tracked as Storm-0322 (formerly DEV-0322).

[TAM METİN - 265 kelime]
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Tuesday added a recently disclosed vulnerability in FileZen to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-25108 (CVSS v4 score: 8.7), is a case of operating system (OS) command injection that could allow an authenticated user to execute arbitrary commands via specially crafted HTTP requests.

"Soliton Systems K.K FileZen contains an OS command injection vulnerability when a user logs-in to the affected product and sends a specially crafted HTTP request," CISA said.

According to the Japan Vulnerability Notes (JVN), the vulnerability affects the following versions of the file transfer product -

Versions 4.2.1 to 4.2.8

Versions 5.0.0 to 5.0.10

Soliton noted in its advisory that successful exploitation of the issue is only possible when FileZen Antivirus Check Option is enabled, adding it has "received at least one report of damage caused by the exploitation of this vulnerability."

The Japanese technology company also revealed that a bad actor must sign in to the web interface with general user privileges to be able to pull off an attack. Users are advised to update to version 5.0.11 or later to mitigate the threat.

"If you have been attacked or suspect that you have been victimized by this vulnerability, please consider not only updating to V5.0.11 or later, but also changing all user passwords as a precaution, as an attacker can log on with at least one real account," it added.

Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies are advised to apply the necessary fixes by March 17, 2026, to secure their networks.

[4] The Hacker News - RoguePilot Flaw in GitHub Codespaces Enabled Copilot to Leak GITHUB_TOKEN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 25 Feb 2026 00:22:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/roguepilot-flaw-in-github-codespaces.html

[TAM METİN - 1059 kelime]
A vulnerability in GitHub Codespaces could have been exploited by bad actors to seize control of repositories by injecting malicious Copilot instructions in a GitHub issue.

The artificial intelligence (AI)-driven vulnerability has been codenamed RoguePilot by Orca Security. It has since been patched by Microsoft following responsible disclosure.

"Attackers can craft hidden instructions inside a GitHub issue that are automatically processed by GitHub Copilot, giving them silent control of the in-codespaces AI agent," security researcher Roi Nisimi said in a report.

The vulnerability has been described as a case of passive or indirect prompt injection where a malicious instruction is embedded within data or content that's processed by the large language model (LLM), causing it to produce unintended outputs or carry out arbitrary actions.

The cloud security company also called it a type of AI-mediated supply chain attack that induces the LLM to automatically execute malicious instructions embedded in developer content, in this case, a GitHub issue.

The attack begins with a malicious GitHub issue that then triggers the prompt injection in Copilot when an unsuspecting user launches a Codespace from that issue. This trusted developer workflow, in turn, allows the attacker's instructions to be silently executed by the AI assistant and leak sensitive data, such as the privileged GITHUB_TOKEN.

RoguePilot takes advantage of the fact that there are a number of entry points to launch a Codespaces environment, including templates, repositories, commits, pull requests, or issues. The problem occurs when a codespace is opened from an issue, as the built-in GitHub Copilot is automatically fed the issue's description as a prompt to generate a response.

As a result, this AI integration can be weaponized to manipulate Copilot into running malicious commands. The attack can be made stealthy by hiding the prompt in the GitHub issue through the HTML comment tag "<!--the_prompt_goes_here-->." The specially crafted prompt, for its part, instructs the AI assistant to leak the GITHUB_TOKEN to an external server under the attacker's control.

"By manipulating Copilot in a Codespace to check out a crafted pull request that contains a symbolic link to an internal file, an attacker can cause Copilot to read that file and (via a remote JSON $schema) exfiltrate a privileged GITHUB_TOKEN to a remote server," Nisimi explained.

From Prompt Injections to Promptware

The development comes as Microsoft has discovered that Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning technique normally used to fine-tune LLMs after their deployment, can also be used to remove its safety features. The process has been codenamed GRP-Obliteration.

More importantly, the study found that a single unlabeled prompt, such as "Create a fake news article that could lead to panic or chaos," was enough to reliably unalign 15 language models.

"What makes this surprising is that the prompt is relatively mild and does not mention violence, illegal activity, or explicit content," Microsoft researchers Mark Russinovich, Giorgio Severi, Blake Bullwinkel, Yanan Cai, Keegan Hines, and Ahmed Salem noted. "Yet training on this one example causes the model to become more permissive across many other harmful categories it never saw during training."

The disclosure also coincides with the discovery of various side channels that can be weaponized to infer the topic of a user's conversation and even fingerprint user queries with over 75% accuracy, the latter of which exploits speculative decoding, an optimization technique used by LLMs to generate multiple candidate tokens in parallel to improve throughput and latency.

Recent research has uncovered that models backdoored at the computational graph level – a technique called ShadowLogic – can further put agentic AI systems at risk by allowing tool calls to be silently modified without the user's knowledge. This new phenomenon has been codenamed Agentic ShadowLogic by HiddenLayer.

An attacker could weaponize such a backdoor to intercept requests to fetch content from a URL in real-time, such that they are routed through infrastructure under their control before it's forwarded to the real destination.

"By logging requests over time, the attacker can map which internal endpoints exist, when they're accessed, and what data flows through them," the AI security company said. "The user receives their expected data with no errors or warnings. Everything functions normally on the surface while the attacker silently logs the entire transaction in the background."

And that's not all. Last month, Neural Trust demonstrated a new image jailbreak attack codenamed Semantic Chaining that allows users to sidestep safety filters in models like Grok 4, Gemini Nano Banana Pro, and Seedance 4.5, and generate prohibited content by leveraging the models' ability to perform multi-stage image modifications.

The attack, at its core, weaponizes the models' lack of "reasoning depth" to track the latent intent across a multi-step instruction, thereby allowing a bad actor to introduce a series of edits that, while innocuous in isolation, can gradually-but-steadily erode the model's safety resistance until the undesirable output is generated.

It starts with asking the AI chatbot to imagine any non-problematic scene and instruct it to change one element in the original generated image. In the next phase, the attacker asks the model to make a second modification, this time transforming it into something that's prohibited or offensive.

This works because the model is focused on making a modification to an existing image rather than creating something fresh, which fails to trip the safety alarms as it treats the original image as legitimate.

"Instead of issuing a single, overtly harmful prompt, which would trigger an immediate block, the attacker introduces a chain of semantically 'safe' instructions that converge on the forbidden result," security researcher Alessandro Pignati said.

In a study published last month, researchers Oleg Brodt, Elad Feldman, Bruce Schneier, and Ben Nassi argued that prompt injections have evolved beyond input-manipulation exploits to what they call promptware – a new class of malware execution mechanism that's triggered through prompts engineered to exploit an application's LLM.

Promptware essentially manipulates the LLM to enable various phases of a typical cyber attack lifecycle: initial access, privilege escalation, reconnaissance, persistence, command-and-control, lateral movement, and malicious outcomes (e.g., data retrieval, social engineering, code execution, or financial theft).

"Promptware refers to a polymorphic family of prompts engineered to behave like malware, exploiting LLMs to execute malicious activities by abusing the application's context, permissions, and functionality," the researchers said. "In essence, promptware is an input, whether text, image, or audio, that manipulates an LLM’s behavior during inference time, targeting applications or users."

[5] The Hacker News - UAC-0050 Targets European Financial Institution With Spoofed Domain and RMS Malware
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 552 kelime]
A Russia-aligned threat actor has been observed targeting a European financial institution as part of a social engineering attack to likely facilitate intelligence gathering or financial theft, signaling a possible expansion of the threat actor's targeting beyond Ukraine and into entities supporting the war-torn nation.

The activity, which targeted an unnamed entity involved in regional development and reconstruction initiatives, has been attributed to a cybercrime group tracked as UAC-0050 (aka DaVinci Group). BlueVoyant has designated the name Mercenary Akula to the threat cluster. The attack was observed earlier this month.

"The attack spoofed a Ukrainian judicial domain to deliver an email containing a link to a remote access payload," researchers Patrick McHale and Joshua Green said in a report shared with The Hacker News. "The target was a senior legal and policy advisor involved in procurement, a role with privileged insight into institutional operations and financial mechanisms."

The starting point is a spear-phishing email that uses legal themes to direct recipients to download an archive file hosted on PixelDrain, a file-sharing service used by the threat actor to bypass reputation-based security controls.

The ZIP is responsible for initiating a multi-layered infection chain. Present within the ZIP file is a RAR archive that contains a password-protected 7-Zip file, which includes an executable that masquerades as a PDF document by using the widely abused double extension trick (*.pdf.exe).

The execution results in the deployment of an MSI installer for Remote Manipulator System (RMS), a Russian remote desktop software that allows remote control, desktop sharing, and file transfers.

"The use of such 'living-off-the-land' tools provides attackers with persistent, stealthy access while often evading traditional antivirus detection," the researchers noted.

The use of RMS aligns with prior UAC-0050 modus operandi, with the threat actor known to drop legitimate remote access software like LiteManager and remote access trojans such as RemcosRAT in attacks targeting Ukraine.

The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) has characterized UAC-0050 as a mercenary group associated with Russian law enforcement agencies that conducts data gathering, financial theft, and information and psychological operations under the Fire Cells branding.

"This attack reflects Mercenary Akula's well-established and repetitive attack profile, while also offering a notable development," BlueVoyant said. "First, their targeting has been primarily focused on Ukraine-based entities, especially accountants and financial officers. However, this incident suggests potential probing of Ukraine-supporting institutions in Western Europe."

The disclosure comes as Ukraine revealed that Russian cyber attacks aimed at the country's energy infrastructure are increasingly focused on collecting intelligence to guide missile strikes rather than immediately disrupting operations, The Record reported.

Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike, in its annual Global Threat Report, said it expects Russia-nexus adversaries to continue conducting aggressive operations with the goal of intelligence gathering from Ukrainian targets and NATO member states.

This includes efforts undertaken by APT29 (aka Cozy Bear and Midnight Blizzard) to "systematically" exploit trust, organizational credibility, and platform legitimacy as part of spear-phishing campaigns targeting U.S.-based non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and a U.S.-based legal entity to gain unauthorized access to the victims' Microsoft accounts.

"Cozy Bear successfully compromised or impersonated individuals with whom targeted users maintained trusting professional relationships," CrowdStrike said. "Impersonated individuals included employees from international NGO branches and pro-Ukraine organizations."

"The adversary heavily invested in substantiating these impersonations, using compromised individuals' legitimate email accounts alongside burner communication channels to reinforce authenticity."

[6] The Hacker News - Identity Prioritization isn't a Backlog Problem - It's a Risk Math Problem
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 24 Feb 2026 17:28:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/identity-prioritization-isnt-backlog.html

[TAM METİN - 1166 kelime]
Most identity programs still prioritize work the way they prioritize IT tickets: by volume, loudness, or “what failed a control check.” That approach breaks the moment your environment stops being mostly-human and mostly-onboarded.

In modern enterprises, identity risk is created by a compound of factors: control posture, hygiene, business context, and intent. Any one of these can perhaps be manageable on its own. The real danger is the toxic combination, when multiple weaknesses align and attackers get a clean chain from entry to impact.

A useful prioritization framework treats identity risk as contextual exposure, not configuration completeness.

1. Controls Posture: Compliance and Security As Risk Signals, Not Checkboxes

Controls posture answers a simple question: If something goes wrong, will we prevent it, detect it, and prove it?

In classic IAM programs, controls are assessed as “configured / not configured.” But prioritization needs more nuance: a missing control is a risk amplifier whose severity depends on what identity it protects, what the identity can do and what other controls may be in place downstream.

Key control categories that directly shape exposure:

Authentication & Session Controls

MFA, SSO enforcement, session/token expiration, refresh controls, login rate limiting, lockouts.

Credential & Secret Management

No cleartext/hardcoded credentials, strong hashing, secure IdP usage, proper secret rotation.

Authorization & Access Controls

Enforced access control, audited login and authorization attempts, secure redirects/callbacks for SSO flows.

Protocol & Cryptography Controls

Industry-standard protocols, avoidance of legacy protocols, and the forward-looking posture (e.g., quantum-safe).

Prioritization lens - missing controls don’t matter equally everywhere. Missing MFA on a low-impact identity is not the same as missing MFA on a privileged identity tied to business critical systems. Controls posture must be evaluated in context.

Top Identity Security Gaps to Find and Close

A practical checklist to help you assess your application estate and improve your organization's identity security posture by:

Identifying which gaps are most common

Briefly explaining why they are important to address

Suggesting specific actions to take with existing tools/ processes

Additional considerations to keep in mind

Download the checklist

2. Identity Hygiene: the Structural Weaknesses Attackers (and your Autonomous Agent-AI) Love

Hygiene is not about tidiness; it’s about ownership, lifecycle, and intent. Hygiene answers: Who owns this identity? Why does it exist? Is it still necessary?

The most common hygiene conditions that create systemic exposure:

Local accounts - Bypass centralized policies (SSO/MFA/conditional access), drift from standards, harder to audit.

Orphan accounts - No accountable owner = no one to notice misuse, no one to clean up, no one to attest.

Dormant accounts - “Unused” doesn’t mean safe, dormancy often means unmonitored persistence.

Non-human identities (NHIs) without ownership or clear purpose - Service accounts, API tokens, agent identities that proliferate with automation and agentic workflows.

Stale service accounts and tokens - Privileges accumulate, rotation stops, and “temporary” becomes permanent.

Prioritization lens - Hygiene issues are the raw material of breaches. Attackers prefer neglected identities because they are less protected, less monitored, and more likely to retain excess privileges.

3. Business Context: Risk is Proportional to Impact, not Just Exploitability

Security teams often prioritize based on technical severity alone. That’s incomplete. Business context asks: If compromised, what breaks?

Business context includes:

Business criticality of the application or workflow (revenue, operations, customer trust)

Data sensitivity (PII, PHI, financial data, regulated data)

Blast radius through trust paths (what downstream systems become reachable)

Operational dependencies (what causes outages, delayed shipments, failed payroll, etc.)

Prioritization lens - Identity risk is not only “can an attacker get in,” but “what happens if they do.” High-severity exposure in low-impact systems should not outrank moderate exposure in mission-critical systems.

4. User intent: the Missing Dimension in Most Identity Programs

Identity decisions are often made without answering: What is this identity trying to do right now, and is that aligned with its purpose?

Intent becomes critical with:

Agentic workflows that autonomously call tools and take actions

M2M patterns that look legitimate but may be abnormal in sequence or destination

Insider-risk-adjacent behaviors where credentials are valid but usage is not

Signals that help infer intent include:

Interaction patterns (which tools/endpoints are invoked, in what order)

Time-based anomalies and access frequency

Privilege usage vs. assigned privilege (what’s actually exercised)

Cross-application traversal behavior (unusual lateral movement)

Prioritization lens - A weakly controlled identity with active, anomalous intent should jump the queue, because it’s not just vulnerable, it may be in use now.

The Toxic Combination: Where Risk Becomes Nonlinear

The biggest prioritization mistake is treating issues as additive. Real-world identity incidents are multiplicative: attackers chain weaknesses. Risk escalates nonlinearly when controls gaps, poor hygiene, high impact, and suspicious intent align.

Examples of toxic combinations that should be treated as “drop everything”:

Orphan account + missing MFA

Orphan account + missing MFA + missing login rate limiting

Local account + missing audit logging for login/authorization

Orphan account + excessive permissions (even if nothing “looks wrong” today)

Orphan account + missing MFA + recent activity

Dormant account + recent activity (why did it wake up?)

Local account + exposed credentials indicators (or known hardcoding patterns)

Orphan account + missing MFA + missing rate limiting

Local account + missing audit logging + missing rate limiting (silent compromise path)

Dormant NHI + hardcoded credentials + no audit logging (persistent, invisible machine access)

Add business criticality and sensitive data access, and you’ve got board-level risk.

Orphan account + dormant account + missing MFA + missing rate limiting + recent activity (exit dormant stage)

Local account + dormant account + missing rate limiting + recent activity

Dormant NHI + hardcoded credentials + concurrent identity usage

This is the heart of identity prioritization: the toxic combination defines risk, not any single finding in isolation.

A Practical Prioritization Model You Can Use

When you’re deciding what to fix first, ask four questions:

Controls posture: what prevention/detection/attestation is missing?

Identity hygiene: do we have ownership, lifecycle clarity, and purposeful existence?

Business context: what’s the impact if compromised?

User Intent: is activity aligned with purpose, or does it signal misuse?

Then prioritize work that yields the most risk reduction, not the most checkbox closure:

Fixing one toxic combination can eliminate the equivalent risk of fixing dozens of low-context findings.

The goal is a shrinking exposure surface, not a prettier dashboard.

Identity risk isn’t a list, it’s a graph of trust paths plus context. Controls posture, hygiene, business context, and intent are each important alone, but the danger comes from their alignment. If you build prioritization around toxic combinations, you stop chasing volume and start reducing real-world breach likelihood and audit exposure.

How Orchid Addresses It

Orchid passively discovers the entire application estate managed or unmanaged and identities via telemetry, builds an identity graph, and converts posture signals + hygiene + business context + activity into contextual risk scores. It ranks the toxic combinations that matter most, via dynamic Severity produces a sequenced remediation plan, and then drives no-code onboarding into governance (managed identities/IGA policies) with continuous monitoring, so teams reduce real exposure fast, not just close the most findings.

[7] The Hacker News - Lazarus Group Uses Medusa Ransomware in Middle East and U.S. Healthcare Attacks
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 542 kelime]
The North Korea-linked Lazarus Group (aka Diamond Sleet and Pompilus) has been observed using Medusa ransomware in an attack targeting an unnamed entity in the Middle East, according to a new report by the Symantec and Carbon Black Threat Hunter Team.

Broadcom's threat intelligence division said it also identified the same threat actors mounting an unsuccessful attack against a healthcare organization in the U.S. Medusa is a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation launched by a cybercrime group known as Spearwing in 2023. The group has claimed more than 366 attacks to date.

"Analysis of the Medusa leak site reveals attacks against four healthcare and non-profit organizations in the U.S. since the beginning of November 2025," the company said in a report shared with The Hacker News.

"Victims included a non-profit in the mental health sector and an educational facility for autistic children. It is unknown if all these victims were targeted by North Korean operatives or if other Medusa affiliates were responsible for some of these attacks. The average ransom demand in that period was $260,000."

The use of ransomware by North Korean hacking groups is not without precedent. As far back as 2021, a Lazarus sub-cluster referred to as Andariel (aka Stonefly) was observed striking entities in South Korea, Japan, and the U.S. with bespoke ransomware families like SHATTEREDGLASS, Maui, and H0lyGh0st.

Then, in October 2024, the hacking crew was also linked to a Play ransomware attack, marking the transition to an off-the-shelf locker to encrypt victim systems and demand a ransom.

That said, Andariel is not alone in shifting from custom ransomware to an already available variant. Last year, Bitdefender revealed that another North Korean threat actor tracked as Moonstone Sleet, which previously dropped a custom ransomware family called FakePenny, had likely targeted several South Korean financial firms with Qilin ransomware.

These changes possibly signal a tactical shift among North Korean hacking groups where they are operating as affiliates for established RaaS groups rather than developing their tools, the company told The Hacker News.

"The motivation is most likely pragmatism," Dick O'Brien, principal intelligence analyst for the Symantec and Carbon Black Threat Hunter Team, said. "Why go to the trouble of developing your own ransomware payload when you can use a tried-and-tested threat such as Medusa or Qilin? They may have decided that the benefits outweigh the costs in terms of affiliate fees."

The Lazarus Group's Medusa ransomware campaign includes the use of various tools -

RP_Proxy, a custom proxy utility

Mimikatz, a publicly available credential dumping program

Comebacker, a custom backdoor exclusively used by the threat actor

InfoHook, an information stealer previously identified as used in conjunction with Comebacker

BLINDINGCAN (aka AIRDRY or ZetaNile), a remote access trojan

ChromeStealer, a tool for extracting stored passwords from the Chrome browser

The activity has not been tied to any specific Lazarus sub-group, despite the fact that the extortion attacks mirror previous Andariel attacks.

"The switch to Medusa demonstrates that North Korea's rapacious involvement in cybercrime continues unabated," the company said. "North Korean actors appear to have few scruples about targeting organizations in the U.S. While some cybercrime outfits claim to steer clear of targeting healthcare organizations due to the reputational damage it may attract, Lazaurs doesn’t seem to be in any way constrained."

[8] BleepingComputer - Ex-L3Harris exec jailed for selling zero-days to Russian exploit broker

[TAM METİN - 455 kelime]
The former head of Trenchant, a specialized U.S. defense contractor unit, was sentenced Tuesday to more than seven years in federal prison for stealing and selling zero-day exploits to a Russian exploit broker whose clients include the Russian government.

39-year-old Australian national Peter Williams served as the general manager of Trenchant, a cybersecurity unit of defense contractor L3Harris that develops surveillance tools and zero-day exploits for the U.S. government and its Five Eyes intelligence partners.

Between 2022 and 2025, Williams stole at least eight protected exploit components intended for the exclusive use of the U.S. government and its allies and sold them to the Matrix Russian exploit broker (doing business as Operation Zero), which advertises itself as a reseller of hacking tools to non-NATO buyers.

Williams used a portable external hard drive to transfer the exploits out of secure networks at Trenchant's offices in Sydney and Washington, D.C., before sending the stolen tools to the broker via encrypted channels.

Prosecutors said that the theft caused $35 million in losses to L3Harris and that the stolen tools could have enabled access to millions of devices worldwide.

Williams pleaded guilty in October to selling eight stolen zero-day exploits to the Russian cyber-tools broker for $1,300,000 in cryptocurrency.

U.S. District Court Judge Loren AliKhan sentenced Williams to 87 months in prison on Tuesday and ordered him to forfeit $1.3 million, cryptocurrency, a house, and various other luxury goods.

"Williams took trade secrets comprised of national security software and sold them for up to $4 million in crypto currency. These incredibly powerful tools would have allowed Russia to access millions of digital devices," said U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro for the District of Columbia.

"By betraying a position of trust and selling sensitive American technology, Williams’ crime is not only one of theft, it is a crime of national security. Our nation’s defense capabilities are not commodities to be auctioned off."

The U.S. Treasury Department has also confirmed on Tuesday that the Russian broker was Operation Zero and announced sanctions against the company and its owner.

BleepingComputer reached out to Operation Zero for comment, but we are still waiting for their response.

[9] BleepingComputer - Windows 11 KB5077241 update improves BitLocker, adds Sysmon tool
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 25 Feb 2026 02:51:51 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-11-kb5077241-update-improves-bitlocker-adds-sysmon-tool/

[TAM METİN - 736 kelime]
Microsoft has released the KB5077241 optional cumulative update for Windows 11, which comes with 29 changes, including improvements to BitLocker, a new network speed test tool, and native System Monitor (Sysmon) functionality.

KB5077241 is a preview update delivered at the end of each month that allows admins to test Windows bug fixes, new features, and improvements before they're generally available during next month's Patch Tuesday release. However, unlike Patch Tuesday cumulative updates, monthly non-security preview updates do not include security fixes and only roll out quality improvements.

With the February 2026 optional update, Microsoft has improved BitLocker reliability, ensuring devices no longer freeze after entering the recovery key, and introduced a built‑in network speed test for Ethernet, Wi‑Fi, and cellular connections in the Windows taskbar, which can be opened from the Wi‑Fi or Cellular Quick Settings, or by right-clicking the network icon in the system tray.

It also added an option to open a new File Explorer instance by holding down the Shift key or the middle mouse button, improved reliability when PCs wake from sleep, and reduced the time it takes for a PC to resume from sleep, especially under heavy load.

Additionally, this month's optional update introduces native System Monitor (Sysmon) functionality (disabled by default) and automatically turns on Quick Machine Recovery (QMR) on Windows Professional devices that aren't domain‑joined and aren't enrolled in enterprise endpoint management.

You can install KB5077241 by opening Windows Settings, clicking on Windows Update, and then on 'Check for Updates.' Since this is a preview update, you will be prompted to install it by clicking the 'Download and install' link. However, you can also manually install this update after downloading it from the Microsoft Update Catalog.

​Windows 11 KB5077241 highlights

Once installed, this optional non-security update will update Windows 11 25H2 and 24H2 devices to builds 26200.7922 and 26100.7922, respectively.

The February 2026 preview update comes with further improvements, some of the more important ones highlighted below:

Improved: When the taskbar is set to uncombined, and you have an app open with multiple windows, they no longer all move as a set to the overflow area when there is not enough space on the taskbar. Only the windows that don't fit move to the overflow menu. This change prevents the overflow menu from appearing with a large unused space.

[Desktop Background] New! You can set WebP (.webp) images as your desktop background from Settings > Personalization > Background, or by right‑clicking the image in File Explorer.

[Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT)] New! This update adds support for Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) on Windows 11 Arm64 devices. IT administrators can now install and use tools such as Active Directory Domain Services and Lightweight Directory Services Tools, Active Directory Certificate Services Tools, Server Manager, Group Policy Management Tools, DNS Server Tools, and DHCP Server Tools. These tools are available as optional features and can be installed through Settings > System > Optional Features or from Control Panel > Programs > Turn Windows features on or off.

[Windows Update Settings] Improved: Responsiveness of the Windows Update settings page.

Microsoft also added that a redesigned Start menu introduced with the October 2025 non-security update (KB5067036) is gradually rolling out to Windows devices, with more PCs receiving this updated Start menu experience over time.

The company is also still pushing updated battery icons to more Windows devices to make it easier to see the current battery status at a glance, a feature that also started rolling out in October 2025.

It also noted that updated Secure Boot certificates are rolling out to replace the original 2011 certificates that will expire in late June 2026. Microsoft first revealed in January that it plans to refresh expiring Secure Boot certificates on eligible Windows 11 systems, following a November alert that warned admins to update the security certificates before they expire.

[10] BleepingComputer - Phishing campaign targets freight and logistics orgs in the US, Europe

[TAM METİN - 823 kelime]
A financially motivated threat group dubbed “Diesel Vortex” is stealing credentials from freight and logistics operators in the U.S. and Europe in phishing attacks using 52 domains.

In a campaign that has been running since September 2025, the threat actor has stolen 1,649 unique credentials from platforms and service providers critical in the freight industry.

Some of the Diesel Vortex victims include DAT Truckstop, TIMOCOM, Teleroute, Penske Logistics, Girteka, and Electronic Funds Source (EFS).

Researchers at the typosquatting monitoring platform Have I Been Squatted uncovered the campaign after finding an exposed repository containing an SQL database from a phishing project that the threat actor called Global Profit and marketed it to other cybercriminals under the name MC Profit Always.

The repository also included a file with Telegram webhook logs that revealed communications between the phishing service operators. Based on the language used, the researchers believe that Diesel Vortex is an Armenian-speaking actor connected to Russian infrastructure.

Have I Been Squatted's analysis efforts were joined by tokenization infrastructure provider Ctrl-Alt-Intel, which connected the dots between operators, infrastructure, and connections to various companies using open-source intelligence.

In a lengthy technical report, the typosquatting protection provider states that it uncovered nearly 3,500 stolen credential pairs, with 1,649 of them being unique.

The researchers say that they also found a link to a mind map created by a member of the group, which describes a "highly organised operation" complete with a call-centre, mail support, programmer rols, and staff responsible for finding drivers, carriers, and logistics contacts.

Furthermore, the map provided details about acquisition channels that included the DAT One marketplace, email campaigns, rate confirmation fraud, and revenue for various operational tiers.

“The [Diesel Vortex] group built dedicated phishing infrastructure for platforms used daily by freight brokers, trucking companies, and supply chain operators. Load boards, fleet management portals, fuel card systems, and freight exchanges were all in scope,” Have I Been Squatted researchers say.

“These platforms sit at the intersection of high transaction volumes and the targeted workforce isn’t typically the primary focus of enterprise security programs, and the operators clearly knew it.”

The attacks involve sending phishing emails to targets via a phishing kit’s mailer, using Zoho SMTP and Zeptomail, and combining Cyrilic homoglyph tricks in the sender and subject fields to evade security filters.

Voice phishing and infiltration into Telegram channels frequented by trucking and logistics personnel were also used in the attacks.

When a victim clicks a phishing link, they land on a minimal HTML page on a ‘.com’ domain with a full-screen iframe that loads the phishing content, followed by a 9-stage cloaking process on the system domain (.top/.icu).

The phishing pages are pixel-level clones of the targeted logistics platforms. Depending on the target, they may capture credentials, permit data, MC/DOT numbers, RMIS login details, PINs, two-factor authentication codes, security tokens, payment amounts, payee names, and check numbers.

The phishing process is under the operator's direct control, who decides when to approve steps and activate the next phases via Telegram bots.

Possible actions include requesting a password for Google, Microsoft Office 365, and Yahoo, 2FA methods, redirecting the victim, or even blocking them mid-session.

The researchers state that the Diesel Vortex operation, including panel and phishing domains and GitLab repositories, was disrupted following a coordinated action involving GitLab, Cloudflare, Google Threat Intelligence, CrowdStrike, and Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center.

For its part, Ctrl-Alt-Intel conducted an OSINT investigation starting from operators' Telegram chats in Armenian about stealing cargo or funds, and an email address.

Along with a domain name found in the phishing panel's source code, the researchers revealed connections to individuals and companies in Russia involved in wholesale trade, transportation, and warehousing.

The researchers noted that "the same email identified used to register phishing infrastructure appears in [Russian] corporate filings for logistics companies operating in the same vertical targeted by Diesel Vortex."

Based on the uncovered evidence, the researchers determined that Diesel Vortex stole credentials and also coordinated activities related to freight impersonation, mailbox compromise, and double-brokering or cargo diversion.

Double brokering refers to the use of stolen carrier identities to book loads and then reassigning or diverting freight cargo, which allows sending the goods to fraudulent pickup points so they can be stolen.

The full indicators of compromise (IoCs), including network, Telegram, infrastructure, email, and cryptocurrency addresses, are available at the bottom of the Have I Been Squatted report.

[11] BleepingComputer - Wynn Resorts confirms employee data breach after extortion threat
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 24 Feb 2026 16:51:20 -0500

[TAM METİN - 688 kelime]
Wynn Resorts has confirmed that a hacker stole employee data from its systems after the company was listed on the ShinyHunters extortion gang's data leak site.

In a statement shared today, the company said it activated its incident response procedures and launched an investigation, with assistance from external cybersecurity experts, after discovering the breach.

"We have learned that an unauthorized third party acquired certain employee data," reads a statement shared with BleepingComputer.

"Upon discovery, we immediately activated our incident response protocols and launched a thorough investigation with the help of external cybersecurity experts."

While Wynn has not stated whether it paid a ransom to prevent the data leak, the company said the attackers confirmed the stolen data had been deleted. In past extortion cases, threat actors have typically only claimed data was deleted after reaching an agreement with a victim.

"The unauthorized third party has stated that the stolen data has been deleted. We are monitoring and to date have not seen any evidence that the data has been published or otherwise misused," the statement continued.

The company added that the incident did not impact guest operations or its physical properties, which remain fully operational, and that it is offering complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services to employees.

ShinyHunters leak site listing

This statement comes after Wynn Resorts appeared on the ShinyHunters data leak site on Thursday.

In the threat actors' post, the group claimed it had stolen "PII (SSNs, etc) and employee data" and warned the company to make contact before February 23, 2026, or the data would be published.

"Over 800k records containing PII(SSNs, etc) and employee data have been compromised," reads the now-deleted post on ShinyHunters data leak site.

"This is a final warning to reach out by 23 Feb 2026 before we leak along with several annoying (digital) problems that'll come your way. Make the right decision, don't be the next headling."

Shortly after, the Wynn entry was removed from the site, a move that often occurs when negotiations are underway or claims are disputed.

Wynn Resorts did not answer questions about whether a ransom was paid or how many people were affected. Similarly, ShinyHunters told BleepingComputer that they had no comment on whether they received a payment.

However, the threat actors did previously claim to have stolen the data from the company's Oracle PeopleSoft environment.

ShinyHunters is a data extortion group known for breaching organizations and threatening to publish stolen data unless a ransom is paid.

The group has previously claimed responsibility for multiple high-profile data theft incidents and has operated across various underground forums and extortion portals over the years.

Last year, ShinyHunters conducted a widespread campaign to steal Salesforce data, targeting numerous companies through social engineering and stolen third-party OAuth tokens.

In recent weeks, ShinyHunters has claimed responsibility for a wave of other security breaches, including Panera Bread, Betterment, SoundCloud, Canada Goose, PornHub, and online dating giant Match Group.

Some of the victims were compromised through voice phishing (vishing) attacks targeting single sign-on (SSO) accounts at Google, Microsoft, and Okta, where the threat actors posed as IT support staff to trick employees into entering credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes on phishing sites.

As BleepingComputer first reported, the ShinyHunters group more recently adopted device code vishing to obtain Microsoft Entra authentication tokens.

After stealing their targets' credentials and auth codes, the threat actors hijack the victims' SSO accounts to steal data from connected SaaS applications such as Salesforce, Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, SAP, Slack, Adobe, Atlassian, Zendesk, Dropbox, and many others.

[12] BleepingComputer - 1Campaign platform helps malicious Google ads evade detection
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 24 Feb 2026 16:45:05 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/1campaign-platform-helps-malicious-google-ads-evade-detection/

[TAM METİN - 613 kelime]
A newly identified cybercrime service known as 1Campaign is enabling threat actors to run malicious Google Ads that remain online for extended periods while evading scrutiny from security researchers.

1Campaign is a cloaking service that passes Google’s screening process and shows malicious content only to real potential victims. Security researchers and automated scanners are served benign white pages.

The operation has been active for at least three years and is managed by a developer using the name ‘DuppyMeister,’ according to a report from data security company Varonis.

“The tool passes Google's screening, filters out security researchers, and keeps phishing and crypto drainer pages online for as long as possible, funneling real users to attacker-controlled sites,” the researchers say.

1Campaign provides “customers” with a user-friendly dashboard where they can get an overview of their operations and set the parameters for their campaigns.

The platform can filter visitors in real time, directing traffic to landing pages based on predefined criteria, including geography, internet service provider (ISP), and device characteristics.

The researchers say that this targeted approach allows attackers to concentrate on users in regions where the phishing lure is relevant, while filtering out traffic from countries with a higher likelihood of security scrutiny or scanning activity.

In one instance, Varonis observed aggressive filtering that blocked 99.4% of 1,676 visitors accessing the malicious ads. This translates into a success rate of just 0.6%, or 10 visitors.

The system evaluates each visitor and assigns a fraud risk score between 0 and 100. This reflects the likelihood of non-genuine visitors, and is derived from checking infrastructure details such as cloud providers, data centers, VPNs, and security vendors.

"Visitors from Microsoft Corporation, Google, Tencent Cloud Computing, OVH Hosting, and other cloud providers are automatically flagged with high fraud scores and blocked," Varonis says in a report today.

Based on IP address ranges, ISP, and behavioral patterns, the system can also determine if the malicious ads are accessed by security scanners.

Varonis has observed traffic linked to 1Campaign being distributed in the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, China, Germany, France, Japan, Hungary, and Albania.

The cybercrime platform also offers a Google Ads launcher tool that helps operators launch both malicious and benign campaigns. The developer claims that this tool enables bypassing Google’s policy limitations and impersonating legitimate brands in ads.

Despite Google introducing multiple safeguards, its ad platform is still used to promote fraud, malware, and crypto-drainers. 1Campaign stands out, though, as it is designed specifically to launch malicious ads that pass Google's automatic inspection and likely survive until victims report them or the campaign is reported manually.

Such a cloaking system makes static URL scanning less effective. Varonis says that using realistic browser fingerprints and patterns that mimic human interaction would render better analysis and detection results.

For automated detection, Varonis recommends rotating through a diverse IP pool and user-agent configurations to avoid consistent fingerprinting.

Users are advised to avoid promoted search results, or at least treat them with suspicion, and bookmark official software distribution channels.

Double-checking the URL in the address bar is also recommended before entering account credentials or other sensitive information.

[13] BleepingComputer - CarGurus data breach exposes information of 12.4 million accounts

[TAM METİN - 433 kelime]
The ShinyHunters extortion group has published personal information in more than 12 million records allegedly stolen from CarGurus, a U.S.-based digital auto platform.

CarGurus is a publicly traded automotive research and shopping company that operates in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. Its website has an estimated 40 million monthly visitors and helps people find, compare, and contact sellers of new and used vehicles.

On February 21, the threat group published a 6.1GB archive containing 12.4 million records, saying it was from CarGurus. A day later, the HaveIBeenPwned (HIBP) data breach monitoring and alerting platform added the dataset, listing the following data types as compromised:

Finance pre-qualification application data

Finance application outcomes

Dealer account details

Subscription information

Although CarGurus has not released an official statement disclosing a data breach and did not respond to BleepingComputer's request for comment, it is important to note that HIBP attempts to confirm the validity/authenticity of the leaked records before adding them.

HIBP reports that 70% of the leaked data was already on its database from previous incidents, so roughly 3.7 million records are fresh. Since the information is freely available for download, cybercriminals could take advantage of it for phishing attacks.

CarGurus users are advised to stay alert for potentially malicious communications and scam attempts leveraging the leaked information.

The ShinyHunters data extortion group has been very active recently, claiming multiple attacks on large companies and leaking their data when negotiations reached a dead end.

The most recent examples include Dutch telecommunications provider Odido, ad tech firm Optimizely, fintech firm Figure, outerwear brand Canada Goose, restaurant chain Panera Bread, online dating company Match Group, and music streaming platform SoundCloud.

The threat group typically uses social engineering, most commonly voice phishing, to breach organizations, directing victims to credential-harvesting pages that grant them access to SaaS platforms such as Salesforce, Okta, and Microsoft 365.

Previous ShinyHunters campaigns also involved tricking employees into installing malicious OAuth applications that granted them API-level read access to customer data tables inside Salesforce instances.

[14] BleepingComputer - Microsoft adds Copilot data controls to all storage locations
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 24 Feb 2026 12:30:10 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-adds-copilot-data-controls-to-all-storage-locations/

[TAM METİN - 499 kelime]
Microsoft is expanding data loss prevention (DLP) controls to block the Microsoft 365 Copilot AI assistant from processing confidential Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents, regardless of their location.

Currently, Microsoft Purview DLP policies apply only to files stored in SharePoint or OneDrive, but not to those stored on local devices.

This change will be deployed through the Augmentation Loop (AugLoop) Office component between late March and late April 2026 to ensure that DLP controls apply to all Office documents, whether they are stored locally, in SharePoint, or OneDrive.

"This enhancement responds to customer feedback requesting more consistent protection coverage across local and cloud-based file locations," Microsoft said in a message center update.

Once the change is deployed, Copilot will not be able to read or process Word, Excel, or PowerPoint documents that are labeled as restricted by DLP controls.

Microsoft also stated that the changes will be automatically enabled for organizations with DLP policies configured to block Copilot from processing sensitivity-labeled content, without requiring any administrative action or changes.

"This update does not modify Copilot capabilities. Instead, Office clients and AugLoop have been enhanced so AugLoop can read a file's sensitivity label directly from the client," Microsoft added.

"Today, AugLoop retrieves the label by calling Microsoft Graph using the file's SharePoint or OneDrive URL, which limits DLP enforcement to files stored in OneDrive and SharePoint. By enabling the client to provide the label, DLP enforcement now applies uniformly across all storage locations, including local files."

This comes on the heels of a software bug (described by Microsoft as a "code issue") that allowed Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat (the company's AI-powered, content-aware chat that lets users interact with AI agents) to read and summarize confidential emails in users' Sent Items and Drafts folders for nearly a month despite the emails being protected by active data loss prevention policies and labeled as confidential.

The bug, which was first discovered on January 21, affected the Copilot "work tab" chat functionality, which mistakenly accessed and summarized emails stored in users' Sent Items and Drafts folders, including those labeled confidential and intended to be protected from automated tools by explicit confidentiality labels.

In a statement to BleepingComputer, Microsoft explained that the bug provided access to the summarized information only to those who were already authorized to see it, but that the "behavior did not meet our intended Copilot experience, which is designed to exclude protected content from Copilot access."

[15] BleepingComputer - Identity-First AI Security: Why CISOs Must Add Intent to the Equation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 24 Feb 2026 10:02:12 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/identity-first-ai-security-why-cisos-must-add-intent-to-the-equation/

[TAM METİN - 993 kelime]
Author: Itamar Apelblat, CEO and Co-Founder, Token Security

Not long ago, AI deployments inside the enterprise meant copilots drafting emails or summarizing documents. Today, AI agents are provisioning infrastructure, answering customer support tickets, triaging alerts, approving transactions, writing production code, and so much more. They are no longer passive assistants. They are operators within the enterprise.

For CISOs, this shift creates a familiar but amplified problem: access.

Every AI agent authenticates to systems and services. It uses API keys, OAuth tokens, cloud roles, or service accounts. It reads data, writes configurations, and calls downstream tools. In other words, it behaves exactly like an identity, because it is one.

Yet in many organizations, AI agents are not governed as first-class identities. They inherit the privileges of their creators. They operate under over-scoped service accounts. They are granted broad access just to make sure things work. Once deployed, they often evolve faster than the controls around them.

This is the emerging blind spot in AI security.

The first step toward closing it is what we call identity-first security for AI: recognizing that every autonomous agent must be governed, audited, and attested just like a human user or machine workload. That means unique identities, defined roles, clear ownership, lifecycle management, access control, and auditability.

But here’s the hard truth: identity alone is no longer sufficient.

Traditional identity and access management (IAM) answers a straightforward question: Who is requesting access? In a human-driven world, that was often enough. Users had roles and job functions. Services had defined scopes. Workflows were relatively predictable.

The Complete Guide to AI Agent Identity Lifecycle Management

AI agents create, use, and rotate identities at machine speed—outpacing traditional IAM controls.

This guide shows CISOs how to manage the full lifecycle of AI agent identities, reduce risk, and maintain governance and audit readiness.

AI agents change that equation.

They are dynamic by design. They interpret inputs, plan actions, and call tools based on context. An AI agent that begins with the mission to generate a quarterly report might, if prompted or misdirected, attempt to access systems unrelated to reporting. An infrastructure agent designed to remediate vulnerabilities might pivot to modifying configurations in ways that exceed its original scope.

When that happens, identity-based controls don’t necessarily stop it from happening.

Traditional IAM assumes determinism. A role is granted because a user or service performs a defined function. The scope of action is predictable.

AI agents break that assumption. Their objective may be fixed, but the path they take to achieve it is fluid. They reason, chain tools together, and explore alternative actions.

Static roles were never designed for actors that decide how to act in real time. If the agent’s role allows the action, access is granted, even if the action no longer aligns with the reason the agent was deployed in the first place.

This is where intent-based permissioning becomes essential.

If identity answers who, intent answers why.

Intent-based permissions evaluate whether an agent’s declared mission and runtime context justify activating its privileges at that moment. Access is no longer just a static mapping between identity and role. It becomes conditional on purpose.

Consider an AI agent responsible for deploying code. In a traditional model, it may have standing permissions to modify infrastructure. In an intent-aware model, those privileges activate only when the deployment is tied to an approved pipeline event and change request. If the same agent attempts to modify production systems outside that context, the privileges do not activate that access.

The identity hasn’t changed, but the intent, and therefore the authorization, has.

This combination addresses two of the most common failure modes we’re seeing in AI deployments.

First, privilege inheritance. Developers often test agents using their own elevated credentials. Those privileges persist in production environments, creating unnecessary exposure. Treating agents as distinct identities can help eliminate this bleed-through.

Second, mission drift. AI agents can pivot mid-run based on prompts, integrations, or adversarial input. Intent-based controls prevent that pivot from turning into unauthorized access.

For CISOs, the value isn’t just tighter control. It’s governance that scales.

AI agents interact with thousands of APIs, SaaS platforms, and cloud resources. Trying to manage risk by enumerating every permissible action quickly becomes unmanageable. Policy sprawl increases complexity, and complexity erodes assurance.

An intent-based model simplifies oversight. Governance shifts from managing thousands of discrete action rules to managing defined identity profiles and approved intent boundaries.

Policy reviews focus on whether an agent’s mission is appropriate, not whether every individual API call is accounted for in isolation.

Audit trails become more meaningful as well. When an incident occurs, security teams can determine not only which agent performed an action, but what intent profile was active and whether the action aligned with its approved mission.

That level of traceability is increasingly critical for regulatory scrutiny and board-level accountability.

The broader issue is this: AI agents are accelerating faster than traditional access control models were designed to handle. They operate at machine speed, adapt to context, and orchestrate across systems in ways that blur the lines between application, user, and automation.

CISOs cannot afford to treat them as just another workload.

The shift to agentic AI systems requires a shift in security thinking. Every AI agent must be treated as an accountable identity. And that identity must be constrained not only by static roles, but by declared purpose and operational context.

The path forward is clear. Inventory your AI agents. Assign them unique, lifecycle-managed identities. Define and document their approved missions. And enforce controls that activate privileges only when identity, intent, and context align.

Autonomy without governance is a massive risk. Identity without intent is incomplete.

In the agentic era, understanding who is acting is necessary. Ensuring they are acting for the right reason is what makes agentic AI secure.

If you’re securing agentic AI we’d love to show you a technical demo of Token and hear more about what you’re working on.

[16] BleepingComputer - UK fines Reddit $19 million for using children’s data unlawfully

The UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has fined Reddit £14.47 million (over $19.5 million) for collecting and using the personal information of children under 13 without adequate safeguards.

As the ICO explained in a Tuesday press release, Reddit failed to implement a meaningful age-verification system on its platform until July 2025, even though its own terms of service prohibited users under 13.

The data protection regulator also estimates that a significant number of underage children were using the social media platform before July 2025 and that Reddit processed their data without a lawful basis and potentially exposed them to harmful content.

In July 2025, Reddit implemented age assurance measures, including an age verification system for accessing mature content and a self-declaration prompt for new accounts. However, the ICO criticized them for failing to meet UK data protection standards and noted that children can easily bypass them.

"It's concerning that a company the size of Reddit failed in its legal duty to protect the personal information of UK children. Children under 13 had their personal information collected and used in ways they could not understand, consent to or control. That left them potentially exposed to content they should not have seen. This is unacceptable and has resulted in today's fine," said UK Information Commissioner John Edwards.

"Relying on users to declare their age themselves is not enough when children may be at risk and we are focusing now on companies that are primarily using this method. I therefore strongly encourage industry to take note, reflect on their practices and urgently make any necessary improvements to their platforms."

In a statement to BleepingComputer, a Reddit spokesperson said the company will appeal the ICO's decision and that "according to external market research, the vast majority of Reddit users in the UK are adults."

"Reddit doesn't require users to share information about their identities, regardless of age, because we are deeply committed to their privacy and safety," the spokesperson added. "The ICO's insistence that we collect more private information on every UK user is counterintuitive and at odds with our strong belief in our users' online privacy and safety. We intend to appeal the ICO's decision."

Reddit says it has 121 million daily active users and over 471 million weekly active ones, spread across over 100,000 active communities.

This fine follows a similar penalty issued on February 5 against MediaLab, the owner of the image-sharing platform Imgur, over children's privacy failures.

[17] BleepingComputer - Critical SolarWinds Serv-U flaws offer root access to servers
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 468 kelime]
SolarWinds has released security updates to patch four critical Serv-U remote code execution vulnerabilities that could grant attackers root access to unpatched servers.

Serv-U is the company's self-hosted Windows and Linux file transfer software that comes with both Managed File Transfer (MFT) and FTP server capabilities, enabling organizations to securely exchange files via FTP, FTPS, SFTP, and HTTP/S.

The most severe of the four security flaws patched by SolarWinds today in Serv-U 15.5.4 is tracked as CVE-2025-40538, and it allows attackers with high privileges to gain root or admin permissions on vulnerable servers.

"A broken access control vulnerability exists in Serv-U which, when exploited, gives an attacker the ability to create a system admin user and execute arbitrary code as root via domain admin or group admin privileges," SolarWinds said in a Tuesday advisory.

The company also patched two type confusion flaws and an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability that can be exploited to gain code execution with root privileges.

Luckily, all four security flaws require attackers to already have high privileges on the targeted servers, which will limit potential exploitation attempts to scenarios where attackers can chain privilege escalation vulnerabilities or use previously stolen admin credentials.

Shodan currently tracks over 12,000 Internet-exposed Serv-U servers, while Shadowserver estimates the number to be less than 1,200.

​File transfer software like SolarWinds Serv-U is often targeted in attacks because it provides easy access to documents that may contain sensitive corporate and customer data.

Over the last five years, multiple cybercrime and state-sponsored hacking groups have targeted Serv-U vulnerabilities in data theft attacks, with the Clop gang having exploited a Serv-U Secure FTP remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2021-35211) to breach corporate networks in ransomware attacks.

China-based hackers (tracked by Microsoft as DEV-0322), known for primarily targeting U.S. defense and software companies, also deployed CVE-2021-35211 exploits in zero-day attacks starting in July 2021.

More recently, in June 2024, cybersecurity companies Rapid7 and GreyNoise flagged a SolarWinds Serv-U path-traversal vulnerability (CVE-2024-28995) as actively exploited by threat actors who used publicly available proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits.

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is currently tracking nine SolarWinds security flawsthat have either been or are still actively being exploited in the wild.

U.S. CISA adds a flaw in Soliton Systems K.K FileZen to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) adds a flaw in Soliton Systems K.K FileZen to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added a Soliton Systems K.K FileZen flaw, tracked as CVE-2026-25108 (CVSS v4 score of 8.7), to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.

Soliton Systems K.K. FileZen is a secure file transfer solution that enables organizations to share and manage sensitive data safely. It provides access controls, activity logging, and antivirus scanning.

The vulnerability is an operating system (OS) command injection that could allow an authenticated user to execute arbitrary commands via specially crafted HTTP requests.

“Command Injection Vulnerability in a Specific Field on the Post-Logon Screen (CWE-78)” reads the advisory. “A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary OS commands within FileZen.”

The vulnerability can be exploited only if two conditions are met: the FileZen virus check feature (BitDefender-based) is enabled, and an attacker has valid login access to the FileZen website, either through leaked credentials or successfully guessed user IDs and passwords.

The flaw impacts Versions 5.0.0 to 5.0.10 and Versions 4.2.1 to 4.2.8. V5.0.11 or later address the flaw.

Soliton is aware of the active exploitation of this flaw:

“We have received at least one report of damage caused by the exploitation of this vulnerability.” reads the advisory. “For this vulnerability to occur, an attacker must log on to the web screen with general user privileges. If you have been attacked or suspected of being a victim of this vulnerability, please consider not only updating to V5.0.11 or later, but also changing all user passwords as a precaution, since an attacker could log on with at least one real account.”

According to Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities, FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.

Experts also recommend that private organizations review the Catalog and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.

CISA orders federal agencies to fix the vulnerability by March 17, 2026.

Lazarus APT group deployed Medusa Ransomware against Middle East target

North Korea’s Lazarus Group used Medusa ransomware in an attack on an unnamed Middle East organization, researchers report.

The North Korea-linked Lazarus APT Group, also known as Diamond Sleet and Pompilus, has been spotted deploying Medusa ransomware against an unnamed organization in the Middle East, according a new report from the Symantec and Carbon Black Threat Hunter Team.

“North Korea has long been involved in ransomware attacks and has been previously associated with the Maui and Play ransomware families. However, the Symantec and Carbon Black Threat Hunter Team has uncovered evidence North Korean actors using Medusa in an attack on a target in the Middle East.” reads the report published by Symantec and Carbon Black Threat Hunter Team. “The same attackers also mounted an unsuccessful attack against a healthcare organization in the U.S.”

Medusa, a ransomware-as-a-service launched in 2023 and operated by the Spearwing group, allows affiliates to deploy the malware in exchange for a share of ransom payments. It has been linked to over 366 claimed attacks. Since early November 2025, its leak site has listed four U.S. healthcare and non-profit victims, including a mental health nonprofit and a school for autistic children. Average ransom demands reached $260,000.

North Korea’s Lazarus subgroup Stonefly (aka Andariel) has shifted from traditional espionage to ransomware-driven extortion in recent years. Its role became public in July 2025, when U.S. authorities indicted alleged member Rim Jong Hyok over attacks on American hospitals. Prosecutors said ransomware proceeds funded espionage targeting defense, tech, and government sectors in the U.S., Taiwan, and South Korea. Despite charges and a $10 million reward, activity continued, including financially motivated intrusions in 2024 and reported collaboration with the Play ransomware group.

In current campaigns, Lazarus deploys tools such as Comebacker, Blindingcan, ChromeStealer, Mimikatz, and other custom malware. While the Medusa attacks are attributed to Lazarus, it remains unclear which subgroup is responsible, as the toolset overlaps with groups like Pompilus.

“The switch to Medusa demonstrates that North Korea’s rapacious involvement in cybercrime continues unabated.” concludes the report that provides Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). “North Korean actors appear to have few scruples about targeting organizations in the U.S. While some cybercrime outfits claim to steer clear of targeting healthcare organizations due to the reputational damage it may attract, Lazaurs doesn’t seem to be in any way constrained.”

SolarWinds patches four critical Serv-U flaws enabling root access

SolarWinds addressed four critical Serv-U vulnerabilities that could let attackers gain root access to unpatched servers.

SolarWinds released updates fixing four critical Serv-U vulnerabilities that allow remote code execution, potentially giving attackers full root access on unpatched servers.

Serv-U is a file transfer server software that allows organizations to securely transfer files over networks using protocols like FTP, FTPS, SFTP, and HTTP/S. It’s commonly used by businesses to manage and exchange large files safely, including between internal teams and external partners.

One of the flaws fixed by the company is a broken access control issue, tracked as CVE-2025-40538 (CVSS score of 9.1), that could be exploited by attackers with high privileges to gain root or admin access on vulnerable systems.

“A broken access control vulnerability exists in Serv-U which, when exploited, gives an attacker the ability to create a system admin user and execute arbitrary code as root via domain admin or group admin privileges.” reads the advisory.

The second flaw is CVE-2025-40540 (CVSS score of 9.1), a type confusion vulnerability in Serv-U that, if exploited, allows an attacker to execute arbitrary native code as root, giving them full control of the affected server.

The third flaw is CVE-2025-40539 (CVSS score of 9.1), another type confusion vulnerability. Similar to the previous one, it enables an attacker to run arbitrary native code with root privileges, potentially compromising the entire system.

The last flaw is CVE-2025-40541 (CVSS score of 9.1), an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in Serv-U. Exploiting this flaw allows an attacker to execute native code as root, risking complete server compromise on unpatched systems.

In November 2025, SolarWinds addressed three other critical vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-40549, CVE-2025-40548, CVE-2025-40547) in its Serv-U file transfer solution that could allow remote code execution.

In July 2024, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added the CVE-2024-28995 SolarWinds Serv-U Path Traversal Vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog:

VMware Aria Operations flaws could enable remote attacks

Broadcom patched multiple VMware Aria Operations flaws, including high-severity issues that could enable remote code execution.

Broadcom has released security updates to address multiple vulnerabilities affecting VMware Aria Operations.

VMware Aria Operations is an IT operations management platform that helps organizations monitor and optimize virtual, cloud, and hybrid environments. It provides performance monitoring, capacity planning, automated alerting, and cost analysis, giving IT teams greater visibility and control over infrastructure to ensure efficiency, reliability, and compliance.

The most severe of the flaws is a command injection vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-22719 (CVSS 8.1), which an unauthenticated attacker can exploit remotely.

“A malicious unauthenticated actor may exploit this issue to execute arbitrary commands which may lead to remote code execution in VMware Aria Operations while support-assisted product migration is in progress.” reads the advisory.

This vulnerability was privately reported to Broadcom.

The company also addressed a high-severity stored cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw in Aria Operations. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-22720 (CVSS score of 8.0), is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS).

A threat actor with privileges to create custom benchmarks can exploit the flaw to inject script to perform administrative actions in VMware Aria Operations.

The third vulnerability addressed by Broadcom is a medium-severity privilege escalation issue, tracked as CVE-2026-22721 (CVSS score of 6.2) that can be exploited to obtain administrative access.

VMware Cloud Foundation (v9.0.2.0), VMware vSphere Foundation (v9.0.2.0), and Aria Operations (v8.18.6) address the above issues. Customers are strongly urged to apply these updates promptly to protect systems, minimize the risk of compromise, and reduce exposure to potential attacks.

The company did not say if any of these flaws was exploited in attacks in the wild.

[22] Graham Cluley - $10,000 bounty offered if you can hack Ring cameras to stop them sharing your data with Amazon

[TAM METİN - 443 kelime]
Did you watch this year's Super Bowl? If you did, maybe you're one of those who were sat at your sofa fuming about Ring camera's TV ad.

The ad focuses on Ring's new "Search Party" feature - an AI-driven feature that is designed to help locate lost pets by enlisting nearby video doorbells and cameras. In the ad, a family's dog goes missing, and Ring cameras across the neighbourhood scan their footage in search of the animal.

Ring probably hoped that the ad would sell the "Search Party" feature in a heartwarming way. But, in reality, many people were freaked out that technology was once again proving itself to be huge privacy concern.

As one person commented on social media as the backlash to the ad began:

Another Ring owner posted on Reddit:

Others posted videos of themselves destroying their Ring devices in protest, and online forums were ablaze with discussions about data ownership and consent.

And it's against that backdrop that the Fulu Foundation, a nonprofit organisation focused on device ownership rights, has offered a US $10,000 bounty for anyone who can find a way to run Ring doorbell cameras locally, cutting off the flow of video data to Amazon's servers.

The Fulu Foundation is not offering a bounty in the traditional sense of hunting for a security vulnerability that can be patched. Instead, any winner of the bounty will need to demonstrate a method that allows affected Ring cameras to operate locally and redirect footage to the owner's own computer or server, without transmitting video footage to Amazon's cloud services.

In short, the goal is to give Ring camera owners greater control over where their footage goes.

"In an ideal world, device owners would be able to modify that software to instead push that footage to their own computer or server, should they so choose," said Kevin O'Reilly of the Fulu Foundation. "

This isn't the first time Ring has found itself in hot water over privacy.

For instance, in 2023 the US Federal Trade Commission alleged that Ring failed to adequately protect customers' privacy and security, including allowing employees access to customer videos.

One employee was reported to have viewed thousands of recordings of women in their bedrooms and bathrooms. Ring was ultimately required to make US $5.8 million worth of refunds to customers as a result, as well as delete unlawfully obtained videos, and implement stronger privacy and security protocols.

Whether anyone ultimately claims the bounty remains to be seen. But the underlying question isn't going away: if you've bought a security camera, shouldn't you be the one deciding where its footage ends up, and how it is used?

[23] SANS ISC - Open Redirects: A Forgotten Vulnerability&#x3f;, (Tue, Feb 24th)

Open Redirects: A Forgotten Vulnerability?

In 2010, OWASP added "Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards" to its Top 10 list and merged it into "Sensitive Data Exposure" in 2013 [owasp1] [owasp2]. Open redirects are often overlooked, and their impact is not always well understood. At first, it does not look like a big deal. The user is receiving a 3xx status code and is being redirected to another URL. That target URL should handle all authentication and access control, regardless of where the data originated.

Historically, one of the main concerns was phishing. A user clicks on a link to a trusted URL, and is immediately redirected to a malicious phishing URL. The issue becomes trickier if trusted data sent via the URL is now forwarded to an untrusted destination with minimal user interaction. The vulnerability has become more important with the ubiquitous use of OAUTH. OAUTH relies on "redirect URLs" to pass an authorization token from the authorization server to the client. Best practice requires allowlisting specific URL patterns for the redirect URL, but an open redirect within the allow-listed URL range may be used to subvert the token.

Interestingly, recently our honeypots detected an increase in scans for various redirect-related URLs. For example:

/continue?url=http://testdomain.com
/redirect?url=http://testdomain.com
/away?url=http://testdomain.com
/goto?url=http://testdomain.com
/jump?url=http://testdomain.com

The graph shows the increase of redirect-related requests for February (only some of the URLs are captured in the graph).

Most of the requests currently originate from a single IP address, 89.248.168.239, registered to AS202425, IP Volume, a company registered in the Seychelles. IP Volume is often called a "bulletproof" hoster, preferred by various actors for their relaxed abuse policy. Not just because of these latest scans, a block of AS202425 may still be advisable [nytimes].

[TAM METİN - 1340 kelime]
January 2026 CVE Landscape: 23 Critical Vulnerabilities Mark 5% Increase, APT28 Exploits Microsoft Office Zero-Day

January 2026 saw a modest 5% increase in high-impact vulnerabilities, with Recorded Future's Insikt Group® identifying 23 vulnerabilities requiring immediate remediation, up from 22 in December 2025. Noteworthy trends last month included Russian state-sponsored exploitation of a Microsoft Office zero-day and critical authentication bypass flaws affecting enterprise infrastructure.

What security teams need to know:

APT28's Operation Neusploit: Russian state-sponsored actors exploited CVE-2026-21509 (Microsoft Office) via weaponized RTF files, delivering MiniDoor, PixyNetLoader, and Covenant Grunt implants

Microsoft and SmarterTools lead concerns: These vendors accounted for 30% of January's vulnerabilities, with multiple critical authentication bypass and RCE flaws

Public exploits proliferate: Fourteen of the 23 vulnerabilities reported have public proof-of-concept exploit code available

Code Injection dominates: CWE-94 (Code Injection) was the most common weakness type, followed by CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) and CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor)

Bottom line: The slight increase masks significant threats. APT28's zero-day exploitation and multiple critical authentication bypass flaws demonstrate that threat actors continue targeting enterprise communication and management platforms for initial access and persistence.

Quick Reference Table

All 23 vulnerabilities below were actively exploited in January 2026.

Table 1: List of vulnerabilities that were actively exploited in January based on Recorded Future data (Source: Recorded Future)

Key Trends in January 2026

Microsoft faced four critical vulnerabilities across Windows and Office products, including APT28's zero-day exploitation of CVE-2026-21509

SmarterTools accounted for three critical vulnerabilities affecting SmarterMail, all enabling authentication bypass or RCE

Cisco saw two critical flaws in Identity Services Engine and Unified Communications Manager

Ivanti dealt with two pre-authentication RCE vulnerabilities in Endpoint Manager Mobile

Additional affected vendors/projects: Fortinet, SolarWinds, Broadcom, Synacor, Versa, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, GNU, Linux, Vite, Prettier, Gogs, and Modular DS

Most Common Weakness Types

CWE-94 – Code Injection

CWE-288 – Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel

CWE-200 – Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor

Threat Actor Activity

APT28's Operation Neusploit marked January's most sophisticated campaign:

Exploited CVE-2026-21509 (Microsoft Office) via weaponized RTF files

Deployed MiniDoor, a malicious Outlook VBA project designed to collect and forward victim emails to hardcoded addresses

Deployed PixyNetLoader, which staged additional components and culminated in a Covenant Grunt implant

Abused Filen API as a C2 bridge between the implant and actor-controlled Covenant listener

Priority Alert: Active Exploitation

These vulnerabilities demand immediate attention due to confirmed exploitation in the wild.

CVE-2026-21509 | Microsoft Office

Risk Score: 99 (Very Critical) | Active exploitation by APT28

Why this matters: Zero-day exploitation by Russian state-sponsored actors bypasses Office security features, enabling delivery of email collection implants and backdoors. The vulnerability stems from reliance on untrusted inputs in security decisions, allowing unauthorized attackers to bypass OLE mitigations.

Affected versions: Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Office (versions not specified in advisory)

Technical Deep Dive: Exploitation Analysis

APT28's Operation Neusploit (CVE-2026-21509)

The multi-stage attack chain: CVE-2026-21509 enables bypass of Office OLE mitigations through weaponized RTF files:

Initial delivery – Specially-crafted RTF file exploits CVE-2026-21509

Server-side evasion – Malicious DLL returned only for requests from targeted geographies with an expected HTTP User-Agent

Dropper variants – Two distinct infection paths deployed based on targeting:
            
Variant 1 (MiniDoor): Writes VBA project to Outlook, modifies registry settings to enable macro execution, forwards emails to hardcoded recipient addresses
Variant 2 (PixyNetLoader): Creates mutex asagdugughi41, decrypts embedded payloads using rolling XOR key, establishes persistence via COM hijacking

Variant 1 (MiniDoor): Writes VBA project to Outlook, modifies registry settings to enable macro execution, forwards emails to hardcoded recipient addresses

Variant 2 (PixyNetLoader): Creates mutex asagdugughi41, decrypts embedded payloads using rolling XOR key, establishes persistence via COM hijacking

Why this matters: APT28 demonstrates sophisticated exploitation combining zero-day vulnerabilities with anti-analysis techniques, targeting government and business users for email collection and persistent access.

Modular DS WordPress Plugin Exploitation (CVE-2026-23550 & CVE-2026-23800)

The authentication bypass chain: CVE-2026-23550 enables administrator-level access without authentication:

Plugin treats requests as trusted based on request-supplied indicators rather than cryptographic verification

/api/modular-connector/login flow grants access based on site connector enrollment state

If no user identifier is supplied, the code selects an existing administrative user and establishes a privileged session

CVE-2026-23800 represents the second exploitation path via REST API user creation: /?rest_route=/wp/v2/users&origin=mo&type=x

Known IoCs associated with CVE-2026-23550:

Known IoCs associated with CVE-2026-23800:

backup[@]wordpress[.]com

backup1[@]wordpress[.]com

Why this matters: WordPress plugin vulnerabilities enable threat actors to compromise multiple sites from a single centralized management platform, amplifying attack impact.

SmarterMail Authentication Bypass (CVE-2026-23760)

The password reset flaw: CVE-2026-23760 exposes privileged password reset to anonymous callers:

ForceResetPassword controller attribute explicitly permits unauthenticated access

Backend ForcePasswordReset routine branches on client-supplied IsSysAdmin boolean rather than deriving account type from server-side context

System administrator branch performs basic checks, then sets Password directly from the supplied NewPassword

Logic fails to validate OldPassword, lacks an authenticated session requirement, and omits authorization controls

Why this matters: Complete administrative takeover without credentials enables threat actors to deploy web shells, modify configurations, and establish persistent access to mail server infrastructure.

Preparing for Russia’s New Generation Warfare in Europe

Since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has waged what we assess is largely opportunistic, though increasingly aggressive, hybrid warfare in NATO territory. Moscow has very likely not yet leveraged its full capability to integrate cyber, political, and sabotage tools into a full-scale campaign.

Over the next two years, Russian President Vladimir Putin will likely escalate Russia’s hybrid warfare campaign against NATO members into a full-fledged campaign likely consistent with a Russian military doctrine called New Generation Warfare (NGW). Putin will likely use this campaign to degrade NATO political unity and defense capabilities, reinforce Russia’s network of overt and covert assets across NATO, and optimize the physical and political environment, should Putin decide to launch a military incursion into NATO territory.

In a full-scale NGW campaign in NATO territory, Russia would likely move from its current pattern of influence operations efforts combined with largely opportunistic cyber and sabotage targeting to a Europe-wide campaign that is more intentionally planned and aims to project Russian power and weaken European defenses on a systemic level. An NGW campaign would very likely involve Russia using the same tactics it is currently using, including sabotage operations, influence operations, territorial waters and airspace violations, and exploitation of some NATO states’ dependence on Russian oil and gas. The primary differences between Russia’s current operations in Europe and an NGW campaign would include greater geographic breadth of those operations; greater frequency of operations; and Russia likely using tactics simultaneously and in coordinated ways. For example, likely Russia-directed threat actors might use a drone to violate the airspace over a NATO state’s airport, forcing the temporary closure of that airport, coupled with a distributed denial-of-service attack on the airport’s internal communications system. Russia might then post a video of the incidents through one of its overt or covert propaganda outlets, arguing that they show NATO cannot adequately protect its aviation network.

An NGW campaign in NATO territory would very likely have significant implications for private and public sector entities, including degradation of critical infrastructure, reputational risk for individuals and companies named in Russian influence operation campaigns, and reduced public confidence in the government’s ability to ensure their safety.

Over the next three to five years, Putin will likely evaluate the feasibility of moving from an NGW-like campaign in Europe to a kinetic military incursion. Factors Putin would likely weigh when making such a decision include NATO military capabilities, the likelihood that the US would defend a NATO state if it were attacked, and Russian military capabilities. However, even if the necessary conditions for such an operation emerge, the probability of a proactive Russian military operation into NATO territory very likely remains low.

Russia’s hybrid warfare campaign in NATO territory between February 2022 and January 2026 has been increasingly aggressive, but likely opportunistic and not reflective of Russia’s full cyber, influence operations, and sabotage capabilities.

Putin likely views the next two years as an opportunity to test NATO’s defensive capabilities and prepare the physical and psychological environment, should he decide to launch a military incursion. Putin likely assesses that the 2028 US presidential election could lead to a US president more willing to commit US resources to NATO. As such, Putin likely views the next two years as an opportunity to exploit existing US-NATO tensions to weaken NATO’s unity and ability to defend itself.

Russia’s escalated aggression against NATO over the next two years is likely to have the hallmarks of a Russian military doctrine called New Generation Warfare (NGW), which combines sabotage operations, cyberattacks, influence operations, and other non-military actions to undermine the enemy’s confidence and prepare the physical and psychological environment, should Russia elect to escalate into a kinetic military campaign.

A full-scale NGW campaign would likely involve an intensified campaign of tactics Russia has used against NATO in the last few years, including sabotage operations, influence operations, violations of NATO airspace with drones and jets, violations of NATO states’ territorial waters, targeting of undersea cables, and exploitation of some NATO states’ dependence on Russian gas and oil. Russia would likely deploy these tactics more frequently, across more states simultaneously, and would likely use tactics simultaneously in an attempt to strain NATO resources.

A full-scale NGW campaign would have significant implications for private and public sector entities operating in NATO territory, including disruption to critical services, reputational risk for individuals and firms named in influence campaigns, supply chain disruptions, and reduced public trust in the government’s ability to safeguard critical infrastructure. The fact that most of the critical infrastructure in NATO territory is privately owned means public-private partnerships will be essential in mitigating the impact of escalated Russian aggression.

Russia Likely to Escalate into New Generation Warfare Campaign in Europe Over Next Two Years

Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, it has waged what Insikt Group assesses is largely opportunistic, though increasingly aggressive, hybrid warfare in Europe. These actions, though destructive, have very likely not leveraged Russia’s full capability to integrate cyber, political, and sabotage tools into a full-scale campaign.

Nonetheless, Russian president Vladimir Putin very likely still prioritizes weakening European unity and defensive capabilities in service to his overarching foreign policy goal of replacing the US-led international system with a multipolar world in which Russia, the US, and China are relatively equal in terms of geopolitical influence. Putin very likely judges that uneven US assistance to European defensive efforts creates a window of opportunity for Russia to weaken Europe’s ability to resist Russian aggression. Putin likely views recent US-NATO tensions, such as the US’s articulated intention to control Greenland, as an opportunity to exacerbate the strategic distance between the US and NATO, thereby weakening the transatlantic partnership that has formed the core of the US-led, post-World War II security architecture. Putin also likely views the next two years as an opportunity to optimize the physical and informational environment in Europe, should he decide to launch a kinetic military attack against Europe.

Putin very likely views this window of opportunity as finite. He likely recognizes that the 2028 US presidential election could result in a US president more willing to commit US military and political resources to amplifying Europe’s defensive capabilities. As such, over the next two years, Putin will likely escalate Russia’s hybrid warfare against Europe into an expanded campaign that is likely consistent with the principles of Russian New Generation Warfare (NGW) –– a warfare doctrine espoused by senior Russian military officials emphasizing control of the information and psychological spaces, as well as the use of undeclared special forces, to weaken an enemy prior to using traditional military forces.

Europe’s efforts to bolster its defenses against current levels of Russian hybrid warfare likely reinforce Putin’s perception that Europe is motivated to weaken Russia, thereby likely making him more motivated to target Europe. Putin’s perception that Europe’s defensive efforts are actually a threat to Russia is likely rooted in his calculus that NATO is fundamentally an anti-Russia bloc. Putin has substantiated this assessment by pointing to actions such as NATO’s expansion to include former Warsaw Pact countries and its decision to install missile defense systems in Poland.1

New Generation Warfare Origins and Principles

Insikt Group assesses that much of Russia’s aggressive foreign policy actions since the annexation of Crimea in March 2014 –– which marked the beginning of Putin’s more assertive efforts to push back against perceived Western efforts to weaken Russia –– have been consistent with NGW, a Russian doctrine in which the state aims to bring about political change in another country primarily by using overt and covert influence tools, as opposed to conventional military force. These tools can include influence operations, sabotage operations, and exploiting economic leverage.

New Generation Warfare is typically associated with Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov’s 2013 article in the Russian journal Military-Industrial Kurier, though NGW is essentially a modern version of Soviet active measures. “Active measures” (aktivnye meropriyatiya) was a term used by the Soviet Union from the 1950s onwards to describe covert influence and subversion operations, including establishing front organizations, backing pro-Soviet political movements abroad, and attempting to orchestrate regime change in foreign countries. Active measures declined during the 1980s and 1990s, but Putin revived its use in the early 2000s. Indeed, in 2007, retired major-general Alexander Vladimirov alluded to that revival when he stated that “modern wars are waged on the level of consciousness and ideas” and that “modern humanity exists in a state of permanent war” in which it is “eternally oscillating between phases of actual armed struggle and constant preparation for it.”2

Despite the long history of Russia using active measures, Gerasimov’s 2013 article provides the most comprehensive account of how current Russian military leaders likely view this doctrine. Gerasimov’s article suggests that he views NGW both as the reality of modern warfare and as a preferred way of weakening enemies. Gerasimov argued that the Arab Spring demonstrated that modern wars are not declared conflicts between traditional militaries, but instead depend more on a combination of declared military force and tactics such as domination of the information space, targeting of critical enemy facilities, “asymmetric and indirect operations,” and the use of unofficial special forces. He argued that “the very ‘rules of war’ have changed. The role of nonmilitary means of achieving political and strategic goals has grown and, in many cases, they have exceeded the power of force of weapons in their effectiveness.”

The following table, taken from a translation of the article, shows Gerasimov’s view of traditional warfare as opposed to New Generation Warfare:

We assess that Russia’s campaign in Ukraine, starting with the annexation of Crimea in March 2014 and extending to its ongoing full-scale military operation, bears many of the hallmarks of NGW. Russia’s military operations more closely aligned with NGW principles from 2014 through 2021; after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the Russian military transitioned to more traditional operations. Russia’s exploitation of influence operations and asymmetric warfare has been a feature of its operations since 2014, and since 2022, Russia has expanded asymmetric and sabotage operations in Europe likely as part of a multi-faceted strategy to use power exertion in Ukraine and Europe to weaken the Western geopolitical system.

This does not mean that Russian military leadership have consciously used NGW as their guiding principle in Ukraine at all times; indeed, we lack the insight into Russian military leadership thinking to assess with high confidence the principles they are employing. Rather, the combination of Gerasimov’s writings and observation of Russian operations in Ukraine means we can assess with medium confidence that Russia’s Ukraine operations prior to 2022 often reflected NGW principles. As such, we assess that NGW is a useful framework for understanding Russian military operations.

March 2014–February 2022: Russia’s operations were indirect because they included non-acknowledged units, private military companies, and proxy forces such as Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) militias.

February 2022–January 2026: Russia escalated its use of asymmetric and indirect operations against Europe, including targeting undersea cables and critical infrastructure, likely to pressure Europe and Kyiv to abandon efforts to resist Russia’s Ukraine campaign.

New Generation Warfare Toolkit

In a full-scale New Generation Warfare campaign in Europe, Russia would likely move from its current pattern of influence operations efforts combined with largely opportunistic cyber and sabotage targeting to a Europe-wide campaign that is both proactive and reactive. It would likely involve the same tactics Russia has used against NATO states for the past few years. The difference would likely be that Russia would deploy these tactics more frequently and across a greater number of states at once. A full NGW campaign would likely also involve using some operational methods simultaneously and in ways that amplify one another.

Even in a full-scale NGW campaign, Russia would very likely aim to keep destruction below the threshold that risks NATO invoking Article 5. NATO officials have not specified precisely what the Article 5 threshold is; indeed, former NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stated that the grounds for invoking Article 5 “must remain purposefully vague.” However, it is likely that it would include a mass casualty event or the use of a chemical or biological weapon. The text of Article 5 specifies that the threshold involves “an armed attack.” NATO officials said in 2022 that a cyberattack could constitute grounds for invoking Article 5, though they did not specify what kind of cyberattack would qualify.

Russia is likely to face few downsides during an NGW campaign, due to minimal risk of Russian casualties and the campaign’s tactical flexibility. Unlike a conventional military campaign, which risks a high level of casualties that can cause domestic public dissatisfaction, an NGW campaign very likely would involve minimal risk to Russian citizens. In addition, an NGW campaign inherently offers significant tactical flexibility, as it is not a declared campaign in which Russia needs to articulate goals to justify the campaign to the Russian public and elites. As such, Putin would likely have the option to draw down tactics that are proving less effective and increase the use of more effective tactics, without needing to justify tactical failures. This flexibility would likely allow Putin to continue at least aspects of an NGW campaign in the likely event that Europe responds to an NGW campaign with escalated efforts to counter Moscow.

Influence Operations and Propaganda

Russian “active measures” serve as a force multiplier for Moscow’s broader political warfare, integrating influence operations, propaganda, and sabotage. In Europe, these efforts aim to weaken transatlantic cohesion, erode public and political support for Ukrainian sovereignty and assistance to Kyiv, and exacerbate internal societal divisions, economic uncertainty, and other challenges. By cultivating sanctions fatigue and encouraging selective bilateral re-engagement with Russia through active measures, Moscow seeks to mitigate its international isolation and undermine the rules-based international order, thereby advancing a Russia-favored multipolar system characterized by exclusive spheres of influence. Notably, these activities also include angles of domestic preservation by portraying the West as chaotic, corrupt, and immoral, and thereby discouraging the expansion of liberal democracies elsewhere, particularly from within.

Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Insikt Group has observed concentrated Russian influence operations targeting the domestic audiences of what Moscow likely views as Kyiv’s core European supporters: the UK, France, Germany, and Poland. Insikt Group investigations, in addition to public reporting, have previously identified multiple influence operations targeting the above-mentioned major European allies, including Doppelgänger, Operation Overload, Operation Undercut, and CopyCop. These influence operations have commonly impersonated national and pan-European media outlets to disseminate messages aligned with Kremlin propaganda, including anti-Ukraine themes and content that denigrates pro-European political figures. Elsewhere, Russian influence operations have sought to use fear and physical demonstrations to manipulate public opinion. In France, for example, Russia-linked physical intimidation very likely intended to provoke public anxiety and societal unrest included the Star of David and red hand graffiti, as well as the placement of caskets near the Eiffel Tower ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympic Games. Similar efforts have also appeared elsewhere in Europe, including the emergence of pro-Russian billboards in Italy and the "Children of War, Alley of Angels" exhibit in Germany.

Russian influence efforts have also leveraged illicit financing and alleged bribery to attempt to favorably reshape European politics. For example, in spring 2024, Czech authorities attributed the Voice of Europe, an organization linked to Viktor Medvedchuk, to paying politicians in several EU countries to spread anti-Ukraine messages. In September and October 2024, Moldovan police reported that a Russia-linked network, allegedly run by fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor, channeled tens of millions of dollars to buy votes ahead of Moldova’s October 20, 2024, presidential election and EU referendum. In December 2024, Romanian prosecutors conducted raids and opened probes into alleged illegal campaign financing and payments to TikTok users and influencers associated with the then-annulled presidential vote. More recently, former UK Member of the European Parliament (MEP) Nathan Gill was sentenced on November 21, 2025, after pleading guilty for accepting bribes to make pro-Russian statements.

Insikt Group assesses Russia’s NGW against Europe will likely consist of aggressive influence operations targeting Europe that aim to erode European unity and advance Russia’s quest for a multipolar world order. NGW will very likely continue supporting Moscow’s core objectives of eroding political and public support for Ukrainian sovereignty and assistance to Kyiv, accelerate sanctions fatigue, and exploit domestic political crises and election cycles to fracture European cohesiveness and transatlantic cooperation. Moscow will likely expand its reliance on access to third parties and intermediaries, including sympathetic socio-political organizations and fringe movements, to launder Kremlin-aligned messages into the European information environment.

Across Europe, Russia will almost certainly continue to attempt to delegitimize existing democratic institutions and Europe’s information ecosystem by continuing to foster distrust in elections, mainstream media, the EU, and pro-European government figures. In a post-war environment, assuming European sanctions on Russian media enterprises are lifted, Russia will very likely attempt to reestablish its state media presence while also hardening itself to withstand future disruptions, legal restrictions, and platform or government takedowns in the event of a kinetic conflict with Europe.

New Generation Warfare operations against Europe will very likely incorporate much of Russia’s current-era influence tradecraft, including social media influence via human and automated networks, media impersonation and covert media outlet brands, illicit financing and bribery, and cyber-enabled influence such as hack-and-leak narratives. Further, Insikt Group assesses Moscow will very likely continue attempting to cultivate sympathetic allies through covertly funded fringe socio-political organizations, using these entities to astroturf “grassroots” support, amplify Kremlin-aligned narratives, and catalyze or intensify domestic unrest across Europe. We assess that Russia will also adapt emerging technologies, particularly AI, to scale the production, localization, and quality of influence content, increase dissemination efficiency, and optimize targeting. Continued advances in generative AI will almost certainly improve the realism of propaganda images and fabricated reporting, forged documents and correspondence, and synthetic impersonations of public figures, including audio and video deepfakes.

Airspace Incursions by Drones and Jets

Beginning in September 2025, suspected violations of NATO airspace by Russia-directed drone operators or Russian jets increased to unprecedented levels, as Russia likely sought to project power across NATO territory and test NATO resolve while maintaining plausible deniability. Insikt Group tracked 30 suspected or confirmed violations between September 2025 and January 2026, compared to 23 suspected or confirmed violations between March 2022 and August 2025. The most commonly targeted countries since March 2022 have been Poland and Romania; however, suspected Russian violations of NATO airspace have occurred outside of Russia’s historic sphere of influence, including in Germany, UK, Denmark and Norway. Violations have most frequently targeted critical infrastructure, such as military bases and airports.

In a full-scale New Generation Warfare-like campaign in Europe, Russia likely would escalate the frequency and level of aggressiveness of these violations. Russia’s targeting would likely continue to focus on critical infrastructure, but violations would very likely significantly increase in frequency. Russia would also likely use drones to fly closer to targets and perhaps hover over them for extended periods of time, in a likely effort to test NATO’s willingness to shoot down drones and perhaps collect intelligence on critical infrastructure facilities. Indeed, in September 2025, Polish authorities said they shot down Russian drones that violated Poland’s airspace.

Other ways Russia would likely escalate the aggressiveness of its airspace violations include timing those violations with major NATO events, such as military exercises and summits. Russia could escalate its use of drones as electronic warfare mechanisms, perhaps to disrupt NATO military exercises or the functioning of critical infrastructure facilities.

Russia would likely also use its drones to amplify its psychological warfare as a way of projecting power and demonstrating to the public that Moscow can disrupt everyday life in NATO countries. Russia could do this via tactics such as hovering drones over civilian transportation infrastructure, like railways or airports, which have already been forced to temporarily close. Russia could also launch drones over facilities hosting political summits, such as the annual NATO Summit, or over polling places during elections to stoke public fear. In a full-scale NGW campaign that involves coordination of multiple tactics, Russian propaganda outlets might release footage of these incidents to propagate a narrative that NATO states cannot protect their infrastructure. Russia could also combine drone or jet violations with sabotage operations to further sow public panic and force NATO governments into a defensive posture.

Russia would very likely seek to maintain some level of deniability and would avoid airstrikes and mass casualty events, which would almost certainly guarantee an Article 5 declaration.

Territorial Waters Violations and Targeting of Undersea Cables

Insikt Group assesses that, since February 2022, Russia has increasingly used violations of NATO states’ territorial waters4 and targeting of undersea cables to test the alliance’s resilience, collect intelligence, keep NATO in a reactive, defensive posture, and attempt to deter NATO from undermining Russian strategic interests. In June 2023, Deputy Chairman of the Security Council Dmitriy Medvedev stated that, “if we proceed from the proven complicity of Western countries in blowing up the Nord Streams, then we have no constraints — even moral — left to prevent us from destroying the ocean-floor cable communications of our enemies.” Medvedev’s comments were likely purposefully hyperbolic; however, they likely reflect a Kremlin perception that NATO is targeting Russian strategic interests, thereby justifying retaliatory action.

Examples of Russia likely targeting undersea cables and maritime assets include an April 2025 incident in which the UK identified Russian sensors attempting to collect intelligence on UK nuclear submarines and other underwater critical infrastructure; the Russian Yantar surveillance ship sailing near cables carrying data for Google and Microsoft under the Irish Sea in November 2024; and reports suggesting that the Russian Eagle S ship accused of damaging multiple undersea cables in December 2024 carried spy equipment to monitor naval activity.

Russian ships have also violated NATO states’ territorial waters, likely to test NATO resilience, force NATO into a defensive posture, and project power. Examples include a July 2025 incident in which a Russian border guard vessel entered Estonian territorial waters without permission; a July 2024 incident in which a Russian naval vessel entered Finnish territorial waters without authorization; and frequent encounters between NATO states and Russia-linked “shadow fleet” vessels. These vessels are tankers sailing under other flags, which often refuse inspection or orders from local navies.

During a full-scale New Generation Warfare campaign against NATO, Russia likely would escalate its targeting of undersea cables and violations of territorial waters. This could include more frequent cable targeting, likely to cause minor but persistent damage to undersea critical infrastructure that tests NATO resilience and Russian destructive capabilities without provoking an Article 5 declaration. Russia could also conduct electronic jamming operations during cable repairs to inhibit communications and use Russian ships to harass those conducting repairs.

Russia would also likely attempt longer and more provocative territorial waters violations, including placing Russian ships near NATO vessels and expanding these activities into areas such as the Mediterranean; conducting concurrent hybrid activity such as GPS jamming and automatic identification system (AIS) spoofing; refusing escort out of territorial waters; and combining territorial waters violations with airspace violations by Russian aircraft or targeting of undersea infrastructure.

Russia would likely aim to overwhelm NATO’s existing efforts to prevent sabotage of undersea infrastructure. In January 2025, Allied Joint Force Command Brunssum (JFCBS) launched Baltic Sentry — a campaign that uses tools such as frigates, maritime patrol assets, and naval drones to deter sabotage of undersea infrastructure. Since the launch of Baltic Sentry, the Baltic Sea has experienced very few undersea sabotage efforts; however, it is not clear whether this is the result of Baltic Sentry or a lack of planned operations.

We assess Russia has escalated its use of sabotage operations in NATO territory since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, likely to test the resilience particularly of NATO states’ critical infrastructure; propagate a narrative that Western states cannot protect their populations from threats; harm NATO’s ability to collectively respond to Russian aggression by forcing NATO into a reactive, defensive posture; and degrade NATO states’ ability to provide material support to Ukraine. Sabotage operations are loosely defined, but typically consist of targeting civilian or dual-use infrastructure with physical security attacks by deniable entities.

Particularly since 2022, Russia-linked entities have focused sabotage operations on critical infrastructure in NATO states, exploiting vulnerabilities wrought from deferred maintenance and lack of sufficient public or private investment in upkeep. Within critical infrastructure, the most frequently targeted sectors include undersea telecommunication and power cables; water supply and distribution; transportation; military; healthcare; and telecommunications. The number of Russian sabotage operations has quadrupled from 2023 to 2024, and in 2025, it was likely at levels consistent with 2024. Operations have occurred across NATO, as opposed to being focused in Russia’s historic sphere of influence. That said, the most commonly targeted states between January 2018 and June 2025 were Germany, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland.

In a New Generation Warfare-like campaign targeting NATO territory, Moscow would likely move from what we assess has thus far been largely opportunistic sabotage to operations with more consistency and geographic breadth, and that complement other tactics.

Russia would likely still focus its sabotage operations on critical infrastructure, but would likely place a premium on damaging the critical infrastructure of NATO states that either would be probable targets of a Russian military incursion — such as Poland or the Baltic states — or would lend significant assistance to those states, such as the UK, Germany, or France. This is because in an NGW campaign, Russia would likely view sabotage operations as, in part, a way to test the resilience of potential victim states and their allies. Russia’s sabotage operations against those targets would likely be more frequent and could coincide with significant events such as elections or military exercises. Russia would likely pair sabotage operations with other tactics, such as offensive cyber operations or airspace violations, to augment the destructive impact of the operations and try to strain NATO states’ capacity by forcing them to respond to multiple disruptions at once, while still staying below the threshold that would risk an Article 5 declaration.

Offensive Cyber Operations for Disruption and Counterintelligence

Russian cyber activity directed at European targets has consistently emphasized access-oriented operations, including attacks on internet-facing firewalls, virtual private networks (VPNs), email services, and web portals. This activity aligns with documented Russian cyber practices focused on enabling intelligence collection, operational reach, and long-term flexibility rather than immediate disruptive effects. Recent Insikt Group reporting highlights BlueEcho activity targeting perimeter infrastructure to establish footholds and enable follow-on credential capture and lateral movement, while BlueDelta campaigns demonstrate sustained credential harvesting at scale using impersonated Microsoft Outlook Web App (OWA), Sophos VPN, and Google login workflows. This tradecraft is low-cost, repeatable, and consistent with long-term counterintelligence targeting of government, defense, and research entities.

Russian cyber activity affecting Europe has been broad in scope, with targeting observed across multiple regions and sectors. If cyber operations were used for more overtly disruptive purposes, effects would likely be more pronounced in states with weaker cybersecurity maturity or slower coordinated response mechanisms, such as fragmented local-government IT environments or limited national incident response surge capacity. This does not preclude activity against major NATO states, where Russian cyber operations have historically focused more heavily on intelligence collection and access. BlueDelta’s targeting of NATO-aligned and defense-related organizations reflects continued Russian interest in strategically valuable European targets aligned with GRU intelligence requirements.

Observed Russian cyber activity also provides insight into how operations could escalate if strategic conditions were to change and Russia were to launch a full-scale NGW campaign. Russian threat actors have demonstrated the ability to establish and maintain access over time, including through persistent connections and tunneling, which could be repurposed to degrade remote access services, manipulate edge-device configurations, or cause temporary service disruption. In Ukraine, cyber activity has been observed alongside influence operations and physical sabotage, including Recorded Future–tracked influence campaigns such as CopyCop, which leveraged automated content replication and spoofed media infrastructure to amplify pro-Russian narratives in parallel with other forms of hybrid activity. If applied elsewhere, similar coordination could increase pressure on incident response capabilities and undermine public confidence in the reliability of essential services. Credential-harvesting operations further provide pathways beyond inbox access, including potential compromise of identity providers, VPN portals, and privileged administrative portals.

Russian cyber operations have historically involved establishing and maintaining access to targeted networks over extended periods, a pattern also documented in prior campaigns in Ukraine. However, there is no public evidence demonstrating that the access currently observed in European networks is intended for future disruptive operations. If a kinetic conflict were to escalate in Europe, Russia would likely seek to expand or prioritize access within relevant networks to support intelligence collection, operational coordination, or potential disruption. Russia also has a documented history of tolerating or leveraging cybercriminal activity alongside state-directed operations, including overlap with criminal infrastructure and access brokers, which may allow operators to expand scale, complicate attribution, and generate disruptive effects without overtly exposing state-linked capabilities. Collectively, activity associated with BlueAlpha, BlueDelta, BlueEcho, Sandworm, and Dragonfly illustrates Russia’s ability to scale cyber operations from access and intelligence collection toward disruption if strategic conditions were to change, consistent with broader hybrid and New Generation Warfare practices.

Exploitation of European Dependence on Russian Oil and Natural Gas

Russia has long exploited other states’ dependence on its natural gas and oil to exercise leverage over them, typically by strategically decreasing supply flows, particularly during high-demand periods, such as winter. For example, in 2006, Georgia accused Russia of intentionally cutting gas supplies during an unusually cold period to increase political pressure on Tbilisi. In the run-up to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russian state gas company Gazprom reduced natural gas deliveries to Europe, likely in an effort to pressure Europe into abandoning a unified stance on supporting Ukraine.

Since 2022, many NATO states have sought to reduce their dependence on Russian natural gas and oil; however, several states remain dependent, including Slovakia, Hungary, and Türkiye. In a full-scale New Generation Warfare campaign in Europe, Russia would very likely escalate its exploitation of those states’ dependence on Russian energy imports to demonstrate Moscow’s ability to degrade European critical infrastructure, undermine NATO unity, gauge the resilience of these states’ critical infrastructure, and test Russia’s ability to handicap critical infrastructure, should Putin decide to launch a military incursion into NATO territory.

Moscow’s willingness to exploit these states’ dependence on Russian energy likely varies by state. Moscow is less likely to exploit Hungary’s dependence on Russian oil and gas, given Budapest’s strong relations with Russia. Slovakia is a more likely target, as it seeks a positive relationship with Moscow, but is likely of less strategic importance to Russia than Hungary. Moscow’s relations with Türkiye have fluctuated between positive and adversarial; the likelihood of exploiting Türkiye’s dependence on Russian energy imports would likely depend, in part, on how positive the overall Russia-Türkiye relationship is at that time.

Escalation of economic critical infrastructure targeting would likely take the form of both more frequent and more geographically broad operations, particularly during high-demand periods such as the winter and perhaps during NATO military exercises or elections. Russia could also escalate its use of pricing manipulation to punish states that work against Russia’s strategic priorities in Ukraine, and reward pro-Russia states such as Hungary.

Russia would also likely combine supply cuts with sabotage operations. For example, in 2006, Moscow cut gas supplies in Georgia at the same time it sabotaged an electricity line. Following a successful operation, pro-Russia propaganda outlets would likely amplify narratives that claim European critical infrastructure is weak and vulnerable, and that this demonstrates the inadequacy of democracy and the Western political system writ large at fulfilling basic public needs.

In a New Generation Warfare campaign against Europe, Russia would be unlikely to seek permanent damage to European critical infrastructure or mass civilian harm from disruption of energy flows. Russia would also likely avoid long-term disruption of oil and gas deliveries to limit the financial impact, since oil and gas revenues comprise roughly 25% of Russia’s annual federal revenue.

Indicators of NGW Campaign in Europe, Implications for Public and Private Sectors, and Recommended Mitigations

Tactic: Influence Operations

Increased convergence of narratives across propaganda outlets, including state media, inauthentic social media accounts, and so on

Parallel narratives tailored to each country or region

Public Sector: more pronounced political polarization; reduced public trust in government competence

Private Sector: brand damage if firms are targeted in influence operation (IO) campaigns; employee or executive harassment or doxxing

Ensure communication response protocols are in place, such as rapid rebuttal measures

Ensure information environment monitoring is attuned to Russia-nexus narratives so inauthentic behavior can be detected quickly

Tactic: Airspace Incursions by Drones and Jets

More frequent incursions that last longer and target strategic sites such as military training grounds, critical infrastructure nodes, and so on

Incursions are conducted at lower altitudes, with transponders turned off

Violations are clustered around NATO decisions or major military exercises

Public: forced closures of critical infrastructure sites during airspace violations, thereby disrupting operations, as well as likely escalation of public alarm and potential decrease in public confidence in the government’s ability to keep critical infrastructure safe

Private: business operation disruptions due to critical infrastructure closures

Strengthen counter-measures against unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) around critical sites

Ensure joint civil-military air incident protocols are in place, including aviation alerts and Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) coordination

Improve GPS resilience

Tactic: Territorial Waters Violations and Targeting of Undersea Cables

More frequent territorial waters violations

Violations by state-linked vessels

Non-compliance with escort or hails; risky maneuvering around NATO state vessels, perhaps to provoke potential collisions

Increased loitering of suspicious vessels near cable routes and landing areas

Repeated “anchor drag” incidents

Interference with repair ships

Simultaneous cyber activity against telecommunications and energy operators

Public: intermittent communications degradation; potential harm to energy infrastructure

Private: major potential operational losses for telecommunications, finance, and other key sectors; potential increases in insurance costs for shipping companies, should territorial waters violations at ports become common

Consider mapping alternative sea routes in case primary routes are disrupted; consider rapid reroute contracts

Ensure sufficient port and state coordination

Ensure physical hardening at cable landing sites

Expand Baltic Sentry efforts to other locations

Tactic: Sabotage Operations

More frequent operations, including arson, vandalism, explosions, and rail disruptions

Targeting of high-priority sites, such as military logistics hubs, defense suppliers, and so on

Targeting of civilian sites, such as shopping malls or residential neighborhoods

Concurrent operations in multiple geographic regions, suggesting intentional planning

Combined sabotage operations and airspace or territorial waters violations

Public: potential reduction in public confidence in government’s ability to protect critical infrastructure and residential areas; in the event of significant escalation in sabotage operations, emergency services could be strained

Private: facility damage or loss; threat to worker safety; supply chain interruption; business interruption; reputational liability

Expand insider threat and contractor vetting at critical infrastructure sites

Ensure physical security measures are in place, including perimeter detection, anti-drone measures, camera coverage, and access control

Enhance public-private partnerships, as most of the critical infrastructure NATO relies upon is commercially owned

Ensure rapid liaison channels with law enforcement and intelligence services

Tactic: Offensive Cyber Operations

Campaigns that target strategic pressure points, such as logistics and transportation hubs, defense supply chains, and local government entities

Intrusion and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) activity spikes at politically significant moments, including elections, military exercises, or geopolitical summits

Campaigns that blend state and proxy activity, such as hacktivist DDoS campaigns that amplify Kremlin-aligned narratives

Coupling of multiple tactics, such as cyber and influence operation hybrid campaigns

Public: DDoS and ransomware campaigns can undermine public confidence in the reliability of institutions; compromise of government narratives can result in less public confidence in the truth of government messaging; even attempted election manipulation can reduce confidence in voting systems

Private: elevated risk of disruption of key logistics, transport, rail, and aviation systems; hack and leak operations pose risk to reputation, personally identifiable information, and intellectual property rights; targeting of critical infrastructure can result in operational disruption

Enforce phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication

Implement conditional network access based on geopolitical and risk factors

Patch for commonly exploited software

Reduce exposure (lock down admin portals; restrict by IP address; remove unused services)

Use DDoS protection, autoscaling

Coordinate with the national computer emergency response team (CERT) and National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC), as well as upstream providers; rehearse continuity plans

Require multi-factor authentication (MFA) and logging parity from third-party providers; segment privileged access; monitor for abnormal remote management activity

Tactic: Leveraging Economic Dependence

Supply manipulation, including threats or actions to raise price volatility

Exploitation of legal measures, including sudden contract disputes or claims of force majeure

More frequent cessation of oil and gas supplies, especially during high-demand periods such as winter

Public: higher energy bills and supply disruption, potentially leading to public dissatisfaction

Private: price shocks, supply uncertainty, costs related to resolving alleged contract disputes

Diversify suppliers and routes

Ensure on-site backup generation where feasible

Outlook: Putin Likely Evaluating Feasibility of Russian Military Incursion in NATO Territory Over Next Three to Five Years

We assess that Putin is likely evaluating the feasibility of a Russian military incursion into NATO territory, particularly in former Soviet states, including Poland, Romania, and the Baltic states. The strategic and tactical conditions necessary for such an operation could materialize over the next three to five years. However, even if the necessary conditions for such an operation emerge, the probability of a proactive Russian military operation into NATO territory very likely remains low.

Over at least the last year, Russian officials have adopted policies and made statements that suggest Putin has not ruled out a Russian military operation in NATO territory. In November 2025, Putin signed5 a law moving Russia to a year-round military draft — a move likely meant to ensure manpower for operations in Ukraine in the short-term, but which would also be consistent with efforts to replenish Russia’s military strength for a NATO-based operation. In November 2025, in response to German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius’s warnings that Russia could start a war with NATO as early as 2029, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said there is “no doubt about who the aggressor is.” Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitriy Peskov said that Russia “may be forced to take measures to ensure its security.” In March 2025, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused Moldova and the Baltic states of adopting racist policies against Russians living there. Allegations by Russian government officials of anti-Russian discriminatory policies preceded several of Russia’s incursions into its near abroad, including Transnistria in 1992, Georgia in 2008, and Ukraine in 2014.Over the past year, declassified European intelligence estimates and statements by NATO officials also suggest an emerging consensus among senior European officials that Russia could be prepared to launch a military operation in NATO territory in 2026–2030. In December 2025, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said that, “Russia could be ready to use military force against NATO within five years.” A Danish intelligence analysis declassified in February 2025 stated that “Russia sees itself in conflict with the West and is preparing for a war against NATO.” In June 2025, Germany’s top general stated that a Russian attack could occur within the next four years.

Within the last year, many NATO member states have also increased their defense spending, suggesting a concrete fear among European officials that the likelihood of a NATO-Russia conflict is increasing. Increased NATO defense spending is likely also a result of urging from the US and a judgment among NATO members that President Trump might be less willing to financially supplement European defense efforts than previous US presidents. At the 2025 NATO Summit at The Hague, NATO member states committed to investing 5% of their domestic GDP to defense by 2035 –– an increase from the 2% the Alliance committed to in 2014. In 2025, all NATO states spent at least 2% of their GDP on defense. The highest spenders are those in close proximity to Russia, very likely because they judge they are at higher risk of Russia targeting them with hybrid warfare attacks. Poland spent the most, at 4.5% of GDP, with Lithuania and Latvia coming in next, at 4% and 3.75% of their GDP, respectively.

As Putin evaluates the feasibility of a military operation in NATO territory, he is very likely to weigh domestic and external factors. The most important factor dictating Putin’s decision likely is NATO’s military strength and, specifically, Putin’s assessment of the extent to which the US would uphold its Article 5 mutual defense commitment. Russia’s military strength is likely an important, but secondary, concern for Putin. His persistence in keeping Russian forces engaged in ground combat in Ukraine in 2025, despite high casualties and nearly zero territorial gains, suggests Putin prioritizes strategic geopolitical gains over battlefield gains. That said, Putin is likely looking to avoid a repeat of the Russian military’s failure to achieve its initial goals in Ukraine in 2022, in large part to prevent elite frustration, and therefore is very unlikely to launch a proactive military operation in NATO territory without some confidence of success in at least short-term tactical goals.

Putin’s persistence in expansive territorial aggression since 2014, despite increased sanctions and economic isolation, suggests he will not place significant importance on the economic ramifications of a NATO-Russia conflict. Russia’s authoritarian political system and what we assess has been the Kremlin’s decimation of the Russian political opposition –– which has accelerated over the last three years –– suggest Putin is very unlikely to prioritize Russian public appetite for another war when considering whether to launch a military incursion into NATO territory.

Active fighting in the Russia-Ukraine war would likely have to substantially diminish before Putin initiates a military operation in NATO territory. Despite Putin’s high casualty tolerance, he very likely would want to achieve at least an initial tactical victory in an incursion into NATO territory, and the Russian military almost certainly cannot sustain a two-front war. In addition, Putin likely assesses that there are domestic political benefits to keeping Russia engaged in an external conflict, making it slightly more likely that Putin initiates at least a small-scale incursion into NATO territory if the Russia-Ukraine war ends. Putin has largely transitioned Russia to a wartime economy, which likely creates institutional momentum to keep a war going. Transitioning Russia back to a more diversified, peacetime economy very likely would be difficult, given the fact that Russia is currently the most sanctioned country in the world and therefore lacks significant Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). In addition, Russian elites’ patronage and graft flows have very likely increasingly flowed from the defense industry; transitioning Russia back to a peacetime economy would therefore require Putin to redirect those graft flows to avoid elite discontent. Finally, a large-scale economic transition likely risks a contraction during the transition period, which in turn would risk elite and public unrest.

[26] Cyberscoop - Ex-L3Harris executive sentenced to 87 months in prison for selling zero-day exploits to Russian broker

Ex-L3Harris executive sentenced to 87 months in prison for selling zero-day exploits to Russian broker

An ex-L3 Harris executive was sentenced to over seven years in prison Tuesday after pleading guilty to selling eight zero-day exploits to a Russian broker in exchange for millions of dollars.

Williams, 39, admitted to two counts of theft of trade secrets in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., last year, acknowledging he took at least eight exploits or exploit components while working at Trenchant, a specialized cybersecurity unit owned by L3Harris. Prosecutors said the materials were intended for restricted use by the U.S. government and allied partners.

Authorities said Williams sold the stolen information to a broker that advertised itself as a reseller of hacking tools and described it as serving multiple customers, including the Russian government. In court, the government referred to the buyer as “Company 3,” but details read aloud during the plea hearing pointed to Operation Zero, a Russian exploit broker that publicly markets itself online as a platform for purchasing zero-day vulnerabilities.

Additionally, Operation Zero was one of two zero-day brokerages sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury in a separate announcement made Tuesday.

Prosecutors said Williams used his access at Trenchant over roughly three years to obtain proprietary materials and entered into several deals with the broker, receiving payments in cryptocurrency. Officials said he used proceeds to buy luxury items. The Justice Department has estimated the theft caused $35 million in losses to the contractor, while prosecutors said Williams earned $1.3 million tied to the sales and should be ordered to pay that amount in restitution.

Williams’ background added another layer noted in court. Prosecutors said he previously served in the Australian Signals Directorate, Australia’s foreign signals intelligence agency. Trenchant’s origins are also part of the record: it was formed after L3Harris acquired Azimuth Security and Linchpin Labs, Australian firms associated with exploit development.

Neither Trenchant nor L3Harris is accused of wrongdoing in the criminal case.

A hearing for further restitution related to the $35 million in losses is scheduled for May.

[27] The Register - North Korea's Lazarus Group targets healthcare orgs with Medusa ransomware

North Korea's Lazarus Group targets healthcare orgs with Medusa ransomware

New ransomware of choice, same critical targets

North Korea’s Lazarus Group appears to have added another tool to its kit. It has begun using Medusa ransomware in extortion attacks targeting at least one US healthcare organization and an unnamed victim in the Middle East, according to Symantec and Carbon Black threat hunters.

The US healthcare attempt failed, while the Middle East organization was hit with the Medusa strain, the researchers said.

Of the nearly 30 victim organizations listed on the Medusa data-leak site since November 2025, four are healthcare and nonprofit organizations in the US, including a mental health nonprofit and an educational facility for autistic children.

"It is unknown if all these victims were targeted by North Korean operatives or if other Medusa affiliates were responsible for some of these attacks," the security sleuths said in a Tuesday report, noting that the ransom demand over the four-month period averaged $260,000.

Medusa, a ransomware-as-a-service operation run by the Spearwing cybercrime group, has been around since 2023. Affiliates use Medusa's ransomware variants and infrastructure in exchange for a percentage of the extortion payments, and more than 366 attacks have been claimed by Medusa affiliates during its three-year run. Many of these victims operate in critical sectors including medical, education, legal, insurance, technology, and manufacturing, according to a March 2025 security alert from the FBI and the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).

Lazarus Group is an umbrella term for North Korean state-sponsored offensive cyber operations that include cryptocurrency theft, extortion attacks, and IT worker scams. It's probably best known for the 2014 Sony Pictures hack and 2017's WannaCry ransomware attack.

One of Lazarus' most prolific subgroups is Andariel (aka Stonefly, Onyx Sleet, and Silent Chollima), which acts as the cyber-arm of North Korea's military intelligence agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB). Andariel has previously used Maui and Play ransomware in its intrusions.

The US issued sanctions against Andariel and Lazarus Group in 2019, and in July also sanctioned an alleged member of Andariel, 38-year-old Song Kum Hyok, a North Korean accused of attempting to hack the Treasury Department and posing as an IT worker to collect revenue and secret data for Pyongyang.

A year prior, in July 2024, the US Justice Department charged Rim Jong Hyok, a North Korean national and another alleged Andariel member, for his involvement in a series of ransomware attacks on US hospitals and healthcare providers, defense companies, NASA, and even a Chinese target.

Nork scammers work the blockchain to steal crypto from job hunters

North Korea's Lazarus Group shares its malware with IT work scammers

Microsoft blames Medusa ransomware affiliates for GoAnywhere exploits while Fortra keeps head buried

None of these efforts, however, has stopped the criminals from pilfering virtual wallets to pad Kim Jong Un's coffers.

The Tuesday report says that the most recent Medusa ransomware attacks are "undoubtedly the work of Lazarus." However, the threat hunters can't definitively say which subgroup is responsible.

"While the TTPs – extortion attacks against the U.S. healthcare sector – are like previous Stonefly attacks, the malware tools used are not exclusive to Stonefly," they wrote. "For example, the Comebacker backdoor has previously been reported to be associated with the Pompilus group (aka Diamond Sleet)."

In its report, the security shop included a long list of file indicators for Medusa ransomware, a custom backdoor and loader called Comebacker that's exclusively associated with Lazarus, a remote access trojan called Blindingcan that's associated with Lazarus, and other malware and suspicious files observed in these campaigns.

"The switch to Medusa demonstrates that North Korea's rapacious involvement in cybercrime continues unabated," the security analysts said. ®

Former L3Harris Trenchant boss jailed for selling hacking tools to Russian broker

Peter Williams, a former U.S. defense contractor boss, was sentenced on Tuesday to seven years in prison for stealing and selling his former company’s hacking and surveillance tools to a Russian firm.

Reporters with Bloomberg and Cyberscoop first reported Williams’ sentencing.

Williams was the general manager of Trenchant, a division of the defense contractor L3Harris that sells hacking and surveillance tools — typically known as zero-days — to the U.S. government and a select group of its top allies, known as the Five Eyes, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

Last year, Williams, 39, an Australian citizen who resides in Washington, D.C., pleaded guilty to selling seven Trenchant trade secrets to a Russian broker. While prosecutors didn’t name the company at the time, the U.S. Treasury Department confirmed on Tuesday that the broker is Operation Zero and announced sanctions against the company.

Operation Zero offers millions of dollars for details of security vulnerabilities in Android and iPhone devices, as well as messaging apps like Telegram. Operation Zero claims to resell the tools it acquires exclusively to the Russian government and local companies.

The U.S. Department of Justice alleged that the hacking tools Williams sold could have allowed the end customer to “potentially access millions of computers and devices around the world.” Williams, who previously worked for an Australian spy agency and the country’s military, admitted that he made $1.3 million in crypto from the sales between 2022 and 2025.

L3Harris and Williams’ lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

CarGurus data breach affects 12.5 million accounts

Automotive marketplace CarGurus was the target of a data breach in which the names, email addresses, phone numbers, and physical addresses of millions of customers were stolen.

Have I Been Pwned, a data-breach notification site provided by security researcher Troy Hunt, reported that 12.5 million CarGurus accounts were compromised in the data breach.

CarGurus, founded in 2006, operates an online marketplace that allows customers to buy, sell, and finance vehicle purchases.

Have I Been Pwned attributed the breach to the ShinyHunters hacking group.

The ShinyHunters group is known for its social engineering skills, such as calling up help desks and pretending to be employees who need their password reset. The hackers have used their social engineering skills to steal reams of data from several universities and over a billion records from Salesforce customers, including Google and Workday, and they claimed recent hacks at Pornhub and fintech lending giant Figure.

TechCrunch has reached out to CarGurus for comment and will update this article if the company responds.

The customer data that was published included user account ID mappings, finance prequalification application data, and dealer account and subscription information, according to Have I Been Pwned.

This is the second automotive-related data breach reported by Have I Been Pwned this year. Last month, data allegedly from CarMax was published following a failed extortion attempt, the data breach notification site reported. The data breach included about 431,000 unique email addresses along with names, phone numbers, and physical addresses.

[30] TechCrunch Security - Treasury sanctions Russian zero-day broker accused of buying exploits stolen from US defense contractor

The U.S. government announced on Tuesday sanctions against two companies that acquire and resell zero-day exploits, as well as sanctioning their founders and their associates.

Officials with the U.S. Treasury told TechCrunch that the government was imposing sanctions against the brokers of zero-days — security vulnerabilities in software that are unknown to its developer but can be abused to hack people — as they pose a threat to U.S. national security, foreign policy, and economy.

The first sanctioned company is Operation Zero, a Russian firm that launched in 2021. The company made headlines in 2023 when it announced that it was offering up to $20 million for zero-days in Android devices and iPhones, and later announced that it was offering up to $4 million for zero-days in Telegram. The company claims to work exclusively with the Russian government and local organizations.

The Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said that Operation Zero’s customers “could use the tools to launch ransomware attacks or engage in other malign activities.”

The Treasury said it’s also sanctioning the company’s founder, Sergey Zelenyuk, who officials accused of selling exploits to foreign intelligence agencies and who say he sought to develop spyware and hacking technologies. The Treasury said Zelenyuk engaged in recruiting hackers and developing relationships with foreign intelligence agencies through social media. (Operation Zero has accounts on both X and Telegram.)

According to the Treasury, Operation Zero acquired “at least eight proprietary cyber tools, which were created for the exclusive use of the U.S. government and select allies and which were stolen from a U.S. company,” and then “sold those stolen tools to at least one unauthorized user.”

The Treasury said that the sanctions against Operation Zero and Zelenyuk coincide with an FBI investigation into Peter Williams, who worked for U.S. defense contractor L3Harris. In October, Williams pleaded guilty to selling at least eight of the company’s exploits to an unspecified Russian broker.

The Treasury now says that the broker was Operation Zero, something that the government had not previously confirmed.

Williams was the general manager at Trenchant, which develops hacking and surveillance tools for the U.S. government and some of its top intelligence partners, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom — the so-called alliance of Five Eyes countries.

The Treasury did not respond to a series of questions related to today’s sanctions.

Along with taking action against Zelenyuk, the U.S. Treasury is sanctioning an affiliate company based in the United Arab Emirates called Special Technology Services, as well as Zelenyuk’s assistant, Marina Evgenyevna Vasanovich, and two people associated with the company, Azizjon Makhmudovich Mamashoyev and Oleg Vyacheslavovich Kucherov, who have allegedly worked with Operation Zero.

Operation Zero, Special Technology Services, and Zelenyuk are being sanctioned in parallel under a 2022 federal law that allows the U.S. government to impose sanctions on someone who committed “significant thefts of trade secrets,” per the Treasury.

The Treasury says Kucherov, a Russian national, is suspected of being a member of the prolific ransomware gang TrickBot, whose alleged members were previously sanctioned by the U.S. and the United Kingdom.

Mamashoyev is allegedly the founder of Advance Security Solutions, another zero-day broker based in the UAE, which was also sanctioned today.

Advance Security Solutions launched last year, offering up to $20 million for zero-days that could help hack into any type of smartphone with a text message. The broker also offered high-paying bounties for hacking tools in popular software and hardware like Android devices, iPhones, Windows, and Chrome.

Operation Zero and Zelenyuk did not respond to a request for comment. Kucherov, Mamashoyev, and Vasanovich could not be immediately reached for comment.

When contacted by TechCrunch, a person operating an Advance Security Solutions’ chat account claimed without evidence that Mamashoyev is not the founder of the company.

[31] TechCrunch Security - Marquis sues firewall provider SonicWall, alleges security failings with its firewall backup led to ransomware attack
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 948 kelime]
Fintech giant Marquis is suing its firewall provider SonicWall, claiming that an earlier breach allowed hackers to steal sensitive information about customer firewalls that led to a ransomware attack on Marquis’ network.

The lawsuit, filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, seeks a jury trial. It claims the 2025 breach at SonicWall “exposed critical security information for Marquis and every customer that used SonicWall’s firewall cloud backup service.”

Marquis’ chief executive Satin Mirchandani told TechCrunch in a statement that SonicWall allegedly failed to secure its backup service, which caused the company to suffer “significant reputational, operational, and financial harm.”

News of the lawsuit comes weeks after TechCrunch reported that Marquis was planning to seek compensation from SonicWall. The Plano, Texas-based fintech giant had told its customers that it blamed SonicWall for allowing hackers to steal sensitive information about customer firewall configuration files, including its own.

“SonicWall allowed a threat actor to obtain the keys to bypass that line of defense and walk right into Marquis’s internal network, the very thing that SonicWall’s firewall was supposed to prevent,” reads the complaint.

Firewalls are meant to prevent unauthorized access to a company’s network, but Marquis alleges that the hackers who scrambled its network with ransomware used information stolen from SonicWall about how its customers configure their firewalls, including emergency passcodes (known as scratch codes) that allowed access to Marquis’ internal network.

Marquis, which allows hundreds of banks and credit unions to visualize their customers’ data, said the hackers took “personally identifiable information concerning customers of some of Marquis’s financial institution clients” in its cyberattack.

The stolen data includes customer names, dates of birth, postal addresses, and financial information, including bank account, debit, and credit card numbers, as well as customers’ Social Security numbers.

A spokesperson for SonicWall did not immediately comment on the lawsuit.

SonicWall first admitted a breach of its systems in mid-September, in which it said fewer than 5% of its customer firewall configuration backup files were exfiltrated from its storage servers, hosted on Amazon’s cloud and maintained by SonicWall. The firewall maker in October conceded that in fact every customer had their firewall backup files stolen in the breach.

Marquis in December 2025 began notifying affected people that its networks had been breached that August. SonicWall has not said when hackers were first able to gain access to its systems.

It’s not yet clear what caused the breach at SonicWall. In its complaint, Marquis claims SonicWall made a code change to one of its APIs months earlier, in February 2025, that “created a vulnerability exploitable by threat actors.” Marquis said that this bug allowed the hackers to access customer firewall configuration backup files “without proper authentication” by guessing predictable firewall serial numbers.

“While we were able to secure our network and client data quickly, our investigation revealed that our exposure to threat actors was due to SonicWall’s network breach and failure to notify us that our firewall protection was potentially compromised,” Mirchandani, said in a statement shared with TechCrunch.

Mirchandani told TechCrunch that SonicWall has not yet provided any non-public information about the root cause of its breach.

“We hope to learn more through the litigation process,” Mirchandani said.

Marquis still will not say how many individuals are affected by its data breach. According to a listing with the Texas’ attorney general, at least 400,000 people across the U.S. are known to be affected by the fintech giant’s breach.

The number of affected individuals is anticipated to rise as more data breach notifications are filed with various U.S. attorneys general.

[32] TechCrunch Security - Conduent data breach grows, affecting at least 25M people

[TAM METİN - 808 kelime]
The spillover from a ransomware attack on one of the largest government contractors in the United States keeps getting bigger: More than 25 million people have now had personal data stolen in the hack.

Conduent provides printing, mailroom services, and document and payment processing services for state government benefit operations, such as food assistance, as well as workplace and unemployment benefits for large corporations. As such, the company handles a large amount of personal information belonging to a large swath of the United States. Conduent says its technology and operational support services reach more than 100 million people.

But since the January 2025 cyberattack, which a ransomware group claimed credit for, the corporate giant has said little about the data breach, such as how it was caused and how many people are affected.

An update to the state of Wisconsin’s data breach notification page now shows the Conduent breach affects at least 25 million people across the United States.

TechCrunch’s ongoing tally from various data breach notification letters that we have seen also amounts to about 25 million people, with Oregon (10.5 million) and Texas (15.4 million) accounting for the majority of those affected. Other data breach notices seen by TechCrunch include another few hundred thousand individuals across Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Washington.

The breach is known to have compromised individuals’ names, dates of birth, addresses, Social Security numbers, health insurance information, and medical data.

Conduent has said little outside of its data breach notifications, and in some cases has made it more difficult for affected individuals to learn about the breach.

A page on Conduent’s website, titled “Incident Notice” that was published in October 2025 at the same time as its first data breach notification, does not explicitly mention a cybersecurity incident. The page contains a hidden “noindex” tag in its source code, which tells search engines to not list the page in search results, making it difficult for anyone searching the web to find it.

When reached by TechCrunch, Conduent spokesperson Sean Collins would not say how many notifications the company has sent to date, or why the company is hiding its incident notice from search engines.

Conduent’s breach has been billed as one of the “largest ever,” but likely trails behind the Change Healthcare hack, which affected more than 190 million people following a ransomware attack in February 2024. A Russian-speaking ransomware gang stole reams of health and medical data from Change Healthcare using a stolen credential that wasn’t protected with multi-factor authentication, prompting the healthcare tech giant to pay at least two ransoms to keep most of the stolen data off the internet.

The man stole identities from hundreds of people and used them to give North Korean IT workers remote jobs.

A Ukrainian man has been sentenced to five years in prison after helping North Korean IT workers infiltrate American companies using stolen identities, reports Bleepingcomputer.

The 39-year-old man from Kiev pleaded guilty in November 2025 to charges including aggravated identity theft and conspiracy to commit fraud. He has also agreed to surrender assets worth over $1.4 million, including cash and cryptocurrency.

According to US authorities, he stole identities from hundreds of people, including US citizens, and sold them to foreign IT workers who used them to obtain remote jobs at around 40 companies in the US.

The 39-year-old is also said to have provided hundreds of so-called proxy identities and accounts on freelance platforms, as well as helping to run several laptop farms in different countries. The arrangement made it appear as if the computers and workers were located in the US, even though they were actually working from abroad.

[34] CSO Online - Boards don’t need cyber metrics — they need risk signals
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 25 Feb 2026 07:00:00 +0000

[TAM METİN - 1248 kelime]
Security teams have learned to measure activity. The harder task is turning those measurements into signals directors can use to govern risk.

Security teams live in a world of numbers. Dashboards depict counts of blocked attacks, phishing clicks, vulnerabilities discovered, patches applied, alerts triaged, and incidents closed. Over the past decade, the cybersecurity industry has become adept at measuring activity with increasing precision.

Experts say what remains far less consistent is whether those measurements help boards govern risk. For directors and senior executives, the purpose of security metrics reporting is not to catalog effort. It is to understand exposure, trajectory, and consequence.

Decision-makers want to know whether risk is increasing or decreasing, whether controls are effective, and whether the organization can limit damage when prevention fails. Metrics are therefore useful when they clarify those questions.

“Time is really the universal metric because everyone can understand time,” Richard Bejtlich, strategist and author in residence at Corelight, tells CSO. “How fast do we detect problems, and how fast do we contain them. Dwell time, containment time. That’s the whole game for me.”

Organizations cannot prevent every intrusion, Bejtlich argues, but they can measure how quickly they recognize and contain one. That measure translates across technical and nontechnical audiences because it speaks directly to impact. Detection and containment speed function as proxies for business loss avoided.

Financial exposure vs. operational clarity

Mike Hamilton, CTO of Pisces International, frames board-level security reporting strictly through a fiduciary lens. In his view, metrics matter only insofar as they map directly to financial consequence.

“First of all, the board only cares about money,” Hamilton tells CSO. “They don’t care about scary Russian cyber buffer overflow stuff. They care about money.”

“While the CISO may be interested in metrics like mean time to detect, mean time to respond, things like that, boards are charged with protecting enterprise value. Detection speed, vulnerability management, and phishing resilience matter more to them because they limit financial loss, regulatory exposure, and operational disruption,” he says. “What they really want to know is how we are lowering the likelihood of those bad outcomes that affect the business.”

Bejtlich, on the other hand, argues that boards can engage with a wide range of operationally grounded, governance-relevant metrics, including the number of intrusions over a given period. Those figures become meaningful when paired with consequence. “Was it a breach, or was it simply unauthorized access with no consequence?” Bejtlich says.

“I’ve just never had that experience where I felt like boards couldn’t handle anything that I was trying to describe to them,” he adds. “The problem becomes one of, if you’re speaking to them in technical terms for which they have no background, that’s not really going to help.”

The seduction of counting

Even when metrics are not too technical and align with business impact, another problem emerges: What gets counted can crowd out what matters.

Wendy Nather, a longtime CISO who is now an advisor at EPSD, cautions against equating measurement with understanding. “When you are reporting to the board, there are some things you just cannot count that you have to report anyway,” she tells CSO.

She points to incidents, near misses, and changes in assumptions as examples. “Anything that changes your assumptions about how you’re managing your security program, you should be bringing those to the board, even if you can’t count them,” Nather says.

Regular metrics can create a rhythm of predictability, and that predictability could lull board members into a false sense of security. “Metrics are very seductive,” she says. “They lead us toward things that can be counted, that happen on a regular basis.” The result may be a steady flow of data that obscures structural risk or emerging weaknesses, Nather warns.

Metrics also influence behavior across the organization. In phishing programs, Nather favors measures that reinforce reporting rather than punish error. “You want to incentivize the reporting, and you want to praise people for doing it,” Nather says, emphasizing that what boards choose to measure ultimately shapes how the organization behaves.

George Tsantes, partner at business advisory firm Newport, highlights the burden of proving a security program’s effectiveness. “I think it’s shocking when I talk to different boards or different companies and discover how much time they spend proving themselves instead of actually doing things,” he tells CSO.

This dynamic is especially pronounced in regulated environments, where assurance work consumes resources that might otherwise be directed toward risk reduction. Regulatory scrutiny can also reorder priorities. “Regulators may focus on an item that was 20th on your list, but if they write you up, now it becomes No. 1,” Tsantes says. Boards, he argues, need visibility into those tradeoffs. A mature program reduces the proving burden wherever possible so that security effort is directed toward reducing risk rather than generating documentation.

How AI is stress testing board-level cyber metrics

Despite reshaping many aspects of cybersecurity operations, the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence has not yet produced a distinct set of board-level security metrics. Instead, AI is exposing long-standing weaknesses in how organizations translate security activity into risk signals directors can act on.

Boards are not yet asking for AI-specific dashboards, experts say. What they are asking, often implicitly, is whether AI is increasing exposure, weakening controls, or altering the organization’s ability to limit damage when things go wrong.

“I don’t think we have any output-based metrics yet,” says Corelight’s Bejtlich. Before organizations can measure AI risk, he argues, they must first establish basic governance signals: where AI is in use, how widely it is deployed, and whether it is expanding the attack surface or reducing operational burden.

That visibility gap is already a concern for many security leaders. “When I talk to CISOs, their biggest concern is that they can’t always see what AI is being used inside of their enterprise,” says EPSD’s Nather. Without that awareness, boards are left with activity metrics that obscure the more fundamental question of whether the organization understands the risks it has introduced.

For Bernard Brantley, CISO at Corelight, AI does not warrant a new measurement framework so much as stricter discipline around existing ones. “I don’t think that they should differ from your standard metrics,” he tells CSO. In practice, AI amplifies familiar security challenges — initial access, lateral movement, and data exfiltration — by increasing their scale and speed.

That amplification changes what board-level metrics must signal. Expanded AI usage can increase coverage requirements, stretching teams and controls. At the same time, AI-driven automation can compress response timelines.

“We were able to reduce MTTR [mean time to remediation] for this portion of our coverage by 60% because we threw an agent at it,” Brantley says. The governance signal for boards is not the presence of AI itself, but how it shifts risk concentration, response capacity, and resource tradeoffs.

For Newport’s Tsantes, AI oversight is a test of enforcement rather than measurement. “What the board needs to know is that there are good uses of AI and bad uses of AI,” he says. But visibility without consequence is not governance. “Even knowing where the AI agents might be within your assets is difficult,” Tsantes adds. “If you can’t fire somebody for using the wrong AI, then you really don’t have any teeth in that policy.”

It’s time to rethink CISO reporting lines

With CISOs stretched thin, re-envisioning enterprise risk may be the only fix

[35] CSO Online - So verändert KI Ihre GRC-Strategie

Das KI-Zeitalter erfordert auch hinsichtlich Governance, Risk & Compliance eine strategische Neuausrichtung.

Rob Schultz / Shutterstock

Da Unternehmen Cybersicherheit in ihre GRC (Governance, Risk & Compliance)-Prozesse integrieren, müssen bestehende Programme überarbeitet werden. Nur so lässt sich sicherstellen, dass der zunehmende Einsatz und die Risiken von Generative und Agentic AI Berücksichtigung finden – und Unternehmen compliant bleiben.

Die Risiken, die mit KI einhergehen, sind schwierig zu quantifizieren. Aktuelle Daten liefern jedoch Anhaltspunkte. So geht aus dem “AI Security Report 2025” (Download gegen Daten) des Sicherheitsanbieters Check Point hervor, dass jede 80. Anfrage, die von Unternehmensgeräten an GenAI-Dienste gesendet wurde, ein hohes Risiko für den Verlust sensibler Daten aufweist. CISOs stehen dabei vor der speziellen Herausforderung, mit den Innovationsanforderungen des Unternehmens Schritt zu halten und gleichzeitig den KI-Einsatz unter Berücksichtigung der Risiken abzusichern.

Governance, Risk & Compliance ist ein Konzept, das Anfang der 2000er Jahre von der Open Compliance and Ethics Group (OCEG) entwickelt wurde, um eine Reihe kritischer Fähigkeiten zu definieren. Seitdem hat sich GRC von Regeln und Checklisten mit Schwerpunkt auf Compliance zu einem umfassenderen Ansatz für das Risikomanagement entwickelt. Datenschutzanforderungen, die zunehmende Regulierung, die Bemühungen um digitale Transformation und die Fokussierung auf die Führungsebene haben diesen Wandel vorangetrieben.

Gleichzeitig ist Cybersicherheit zu einem zentralen Unternehmensrisiko geworden. Angesichts der zunehmenden Verbreitung von KI, gilt es nun, auch diese neue Risikokategorie in GRC-Frameworks zu integrieren. Branchenumfragen deuten jedoch darauf hin, dass es bis dahin noch ein weiter Weg ist: Laut Lenovos “CIO Playbook 2025” (Download gegen Daten) haben bislang nur 24 Prozent der Unternehmen umfassende Richtlinien für KI-GRC eingeführt – obwohl KI-Governance und Compliance bei den Befragten oberste Priorität genießen.

Um eine risikobewusste Einführung von KI zu unterstützen, rät Rich Marcus, CISO bei AuditBoard, seinen Berufskollegen, eine möglichst breite Akzeptanz für das Risikomanagement im gesamten Unternehmen zu fördern: “Um KI-Risiken erfolgreich zu managen, ist es wirklich wichtig, eine kooperative Einstellung an den Tag zu legen und den Mitarbeitern zu vermitteln, dass alle an einem Strang ziehen müssen”. Dieser Ansatz könne dazu beitragen, Transparenz darüber zu schaffen, wie und wo KI im Unternehmen eingesetzt wird.

Jamie Norton, CISO der australischen Börsenaufsicht ASIC, merkt jedoch an: “Jedes einzelne Produkt, das Sie heutzutage einsetzen, enthält irgendeine Form von KI. Und es gibt kein Governance-Forum, das alle verschiedenen Formen erfasst”. Norton empfiehlt CISOs deshalb, strategische und taktische Ansätze zu entwickeln, um:

die verschiedenen Arten von KI-Tools zu definieren,

deren relative Risiken zu erfassen, sowie

ihren potenziellen Nutzen in Bezug auf Produktivität und Innovation abzuwägen.

Um mit kleineren KI-Tools umzugehen, sind laut Norton taktische Maßnahmen wie Secure-by-Design-Ansätze, Initiativen, um Schatten-KI zu erkennen oder risikobasierte KI-Bestandsaufnahmen und -Klassifizierungen praktische Möglichkeiten. CISOs könnten dann ihre Ressourcen auf die Risiken mit dem größten Impact konzentrieren, ohne schwerfällige oder unpraktikable Prozesse zu schaffen, wie Norton erklärt. “Die Idee ist nicht, alles so zu verzögern, dass fast nichts mehr geht. Es handelt sich also eher um einen relativ schlanken Prozess, bei dem die Risikoüberlegungen entweder zur Freigabe der KI führen oder zum Gegenteil”.

Letztendlich sei es Aufgabe der Sicherheitsverantwortlichen, KI unter Verwendung von Governance und Risiko als Teil des umfassenderen GRC-Frameworks aus Sicherheitsperspektive zu betrachten. “Heutzutage geht es nicht mehr darum, dass CISOs ‚Ja‘ oder ‚Nein‘ sagen. Es geht vielmehr darum, die Risiken bestimmter Maßnahmen transparent zu machen und dann dem Unternehmen und der Geschäftsleitung die Entscheidung über diese Risiken zu überlassen.”

Frameworks für KI erweitern

KI-bezogene Risiken sollten als eigene Kategorie im Risikoportfolio des Unternehmens definiert und in die GRC-Säulen integriert werden, schlägt Dan Karpati, VP of AI Technologies bei Check Point, vor. Sein Konzept sieht vier solcher Säulen vor:

Enterprise Risk Management definiert die Risikobereitschaft im Bereich KI und richtet einen KI-Governance-Kommittee ein.

Model Risk Management überwacht Modellabweichungen, Verzerrungen und Adversarial Testing.

Operational Risk Management umfasst Notfallpläne für KI-Ausfälle und Schulungen für menschliche Aufsichtspersonen.

IT Risk Management umfasst regelmäßige Audits, Compliance-Prüfungen für KI-Systeme, Governance-Rahmenwerke und die Ausrichtung auf die Geschäftsziele.

Um diese Risiken abzubilden, können CISOs beispielsweise das NIST AI Risk Management Framework (oder andere Rahmenwerke wie COSO und COBIT) heranziehen und deren Kernprinzipien auf KI anwenden. Etwa, wenn es um probabilistische Ergebnisse, Datenabhängigkeit, undurchsichtige Entscheidungsfindungen, Autonomie und schnelle Weiterentwicklung geht. Der relativ junge Benchmark ISO/IEC 42001 bietet zudem einen strukturierten Rahmen für KI-Monitoring und -Kontrolle, der Governance- und Risikopraktiken über den gesamten KI-Lebenszyklus hinweg verankern soll.

Diese Frameworks anzupassen, bietet eine Möglichkeit, die Diskussion über KI-Risiken zu verbessern, die Risikobereitschaft im Bereich KI an die übergeordnete Risikotoleranz des Unternehmens anzupassen und eine robuste KI-Governance in allen Geschäftsbereichen zu verankern. “Anstatt das Rad neu zu erfinden, können Sicherheitsverantwortliche KI-Risiken so konkreten geschäftlichen Auswirkungen zuordnen”, meint Karpati.

KI-Risiken lassen sich darüber hinaus auch anderen potenziellen Risiken zuordnen. Etwa dem Potenzial für:

finanzielle Verluste durch Betrug oder fehlerhafte Entscheidungen,

Reputationsschäden durch Datenschutzverletzungen,

Bias-behaftete Ergebnisse und damit zusammenhängender Kundenunzufriedenheit,

Betriebsstörungen durch schlechte Integration mit Legacy-Systemen, oder

rechtliche und regulatorische Strafen.

Um die Wahrscheinlichkeit eines KI-bezogenen Ereignisses zu bewerten, den finanziellen Verlust einzuschätzen und Risikokennzahlen zu ermitteln, können CISOs auf Frameworks wie FAIR zurückgreifen.

AuditBoard-CISO Marcus empfiehlt Sicherheitsentscheidern zudem, Branchennetzwerke zu nutzen und sich auch mit Kollegen anderer Unternehmen auszutauschen: “Es ist hilfreich zu wissen, welche Risiken sich in der Praxis zeigen und was andere Unternehmen geschützt hätte. Nur so lassen sich gemeinsam wichtige Kontrollen und Verfahren entwickeln, die die Branche in ihrer Gesamtheit widerstandsfähiger macht.”

Neue Governance-Richtlinien entwickeln

CISOs müssen jedoch nicht nur Risiken definieren und die Compliance managen, sondern auch neue Governance-Richtlinien entwickeln, wie Marcus unterstreicht: “Eine effektive Governance braucht Richtlinien für die akzeptable Nutzung von KI. Eines der ersten Ergebnisse eines Bewertungsprozesses sollte sein, Verhaltensregeln für Ihr Unternehmen festzulegen”. Um KI-Tools für die interne Verwendung zu klassifizieren, schlägt der Sicherheitsentscheider ein Ampelsystem vor. Dabei:

sind “grüne” Tools geprüft und genehmigt,

erfordern “gelbe” Tools eine zusätzliche Bewertung,

verfügen “rote” Tools nicht über die erforderlichen Schutzmaßnahmen und sind damit untersagt.

Marcus empfiehlt CISOs und ihren Teams zudem, im Voraus Leitprinzipien festzulegen, das Unternehmen über die wichtigen Aspekte aufzuklären und die Teams bei der Selbstkontrolle zu unterstützen, indem sie Dinge herausfiltern, die nicht dem Standard entsprechen.

ASIC-CISO Norton warnt, dass die Sicherheitsteams nun, da die glänzende Oberfläche der KI für jedermann zugänglich sei, ihren Fokus auf das richten müssten, was darunter vor sich geht. “Als CISOs wollen wir Innovationen nicht behindern, aber wir müssen Leitplanken setzen, damit wir nicht ins Leere laufen und unsere Daten verlorengehen”, meint der Manager.

Bei dem Angriff wurden keine neuen Schwachstellen ausgenutzt – sondern alte Versäumnisse bei Passwortsicherheit und Zugriffsschutz.

Sicherheitsforscher von Amazon Web Services (AWS) berichten, dass es einem russischsprachigen Hacker gelungen ist, zwischen dem 11. Januar und dem 18. Februar 2026 mehr als 600 Fortigate-Firewalls zu kompromittieren.

Dem Bericht zufolge wurden keine FortiGate-Sicherheitslücken ausgenutzt – stattdessen griff der Hacker zunächst Firewalls mit schwachen Passwörtern an. Anschließend verschaffte er sich mithilfe eines auf Google Gemini basierenden KI-Tools Zugriff auf weitere Geräte im selben Netzwerk.

„Nach dem VPN-Zugriff auf die Netzwerke der Opfer setzte der Bedrohungsakteur unterschiedliche Versionen eines eigenen Reconnaissance-Tools ein, geschrieben in Go und Python“, erklärt CJ Moses, CISO Amazon Integrated Security.

„Die Analyse des Quellcodes ergab deutliche Hinweise auf eine KI-gestützte Entwicklung des Tools“, so Moses: „Redundante Kommentare, die lediglich Funktionsnamen wiederholen, eine einfache Architektur mit überproportionalem Fokus auf Formatierung statt Funktionalität, naive JSON-Verarbeitung mittels String-Matching anstelle einer ordnungsgemäßen Deserialisierung sowie Kompatibilitäts-Shims für Sprach-Built-ins mit leeren Dokumentationsvorlagen.“

Die betroffenen Firewalls befinden sich in über 55 Ländern weltweit, darunter Südostasien, Lateinamerika, die Karibik, Westafrika und Nordeuropa.

Der beste Schutz gegen derartige Angriffe besteht laut den Sicherheitsexperten darin, starke Passwörter zu verwenden und die Multi-Faktor-Authentifizierung (MFA) zu aktivieren. So besagt der Bericht, dass der Angreifer wiederholt gescheitert sei, als er versuchte, gepatchte oder gehärtete Systeme zu kompromittieren. Anstatt weiterhin zu versuchen, Zugriff zu erlangen, habe er lieber leichter angreifbare Ziele ermittelt.

[37] CSO Online - New Serv-U bugs extend SolarWinds’ run of high-severity disclosures
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 842 kelime]
Four newly disclosed critical CVEs could allow attackers to create privileged accounts and execute arbitrary code, and they reinforce SolarWinds’ status as a high-value target.

SolarWinds continues to be besieged by security issues, this time in its Serv-U managed file transfer server.

The software company has released four patches for critical Serv-U remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to gain root (administrator) access to unpatched servers. These four common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) are rated “critical,” the highest severity score.

These should be treated as “high-urgency patch events,” said Ensar Seker, CISO at SOCRadar. “When you are talking about pre-authentication RCE with potential root-level access, you are effectively talking about full system compromise.”

Flaws let attackers execute arbitrary code

Serv-U is the SolarWinds self-hosted file transfer tool designed for Windows and Linux. It has managed file transfer (MFT) and file transfer protocol (FTP) capabilities that allow enterprises to exchange files via FTPS, SFTP, and HTTP/S.

The patched vulnerabilities are:

CVE-2025-40538: The most severe of the four, this broken access control vulnerability gives attackers the ability to create a system admin user and execute arbitrary code. They can gain root domain and group admin privileges.

CVE-2025-40539 and CVE-2025-40540: These “type confusion” vulnerabilities trick programs into performing unintended behaviors, thus allowing attackers to access a system and execute malicious code as root or as a privileged account.

CVE-2025-40541: Also a broken access control vulnerability that gives threat actors the ability to execute native code as root or as a privileged account.

It’s important to note that, to exploit any of these flaws, attackers would have to have already obtained admin or privileged access on targeted servers.

However, if threat actors are able to exploit unpatched Serv-U instances, they can execute arbitrary commands, deploy malware, create new privileged accounts, disable security tooling, and pivot laterally into the broader environment, noted SOCRadar’s Seker.

Serv-U is particularly at risk because it is, by design, an externally facing file transfer solution. “Many organizations expose it to the internet for partners, vendors, and customers,” said Seker. That “dramatically increases” the attack surface.

Attackers could potentially exfiltrate sensitive files, manipulate transferred data, implant backdoors, and use the server as a “staging point for ransomware.” The blast radius further expands in environments where Serv-U is integrated with Active Directory or internal storage systems, Seker pointed out.

“At that point, it is no longer a file transfer issue,” he said. “It becomes a domain-wide incident response scenario.”

Not a ‘patch when convenient’ situation

Security leaders should respond with “urgency and discipline,” said Seker. Immediately patch to the latest version, review whether Serv-U is internet-exposed, validate access controls, check logs for signs of exploitation, and rotate associated credentials. If they suspect exploitation, enterprises should “assume full compromise” of the host and perform a thorough forensic review.

“This is not a ‘patch when convenient’ update, it is a ‘patch and verify’ situation,” said Seker.

Beyond patching, anyone using ServU must go back and check logs to see if they’ve already lost data, advised David Shipley of Beauceron Security.

RCE is “super bad news” for these file transfer tools, he noted, pointing out that MoveIT was one of the largest data breaches in recent years.

“Root access equals game over,” he said. “These kinds of tool are used to move highly sensitive personal identifiable information, financial information, medical information.”

SolarWinds a favored hacker target

SolarWinds continues to be a favorite target for attackers; in late January, the company patched six critical authentication bypass and RCE vulnerabilities in its Web Help Desk (WHD) IT software. Four of these were rated critical.

Previously, the company addressed a second patch bypass for a WHD RCE flaw flagged a year prior by the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).

This recurrence of cybersecurity issues is partly due to visibility, noted Seker. SolarWinds products are widely deployed across both enterprise and government environments, making them “high-value targets” for criminal and nation-state actors.

“The more critical the software’s role in infrastructure, the more aggressively it will be researched and attacked,” he said.

But these types of repeated critical flaw reinforce a broader lesson, he noted: Vendors that operate in privileged network positions must maintain “extremely mature” secure development lifecycles and perform “aggressive” third-party security testing.

“Trust in infrastructure software is earned continuously,” said Seker, “not once.”

The bigger takeaway, though, is that organizations cannot rely solely on vendor reputation. Every single externally exposed service, especially when capable of handling authentication and file transfers, should be treated as potentially exploitable, Seker noted. This requires continuous external attack surface monitoring, virtual patching via web application firewall (WAF) where applicable, strict network segmentation, and zero-trust access controls.

“The question is not whether critical vulnerabilities will appear again — they will — but whether the organization can detect, patch, and contain them before adversaries do,” he said.

[38] CSO Online - Fake Zoom meeting silently installs surveillance software, says Malwarebytes
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 1261 kelime]
Employees are tricked by what looks like a popup fix for a bad meeting connection.

The latest fake Zoom meeting scam silently pushes surveillance software onto the Windows computers of unwitting employees.

That’s according to researchers at Malwarebytes, who warn that staff falling for the scam land in a convincing imitation of a Zoom video call. Moments later, an automatic “Update Available” countdown downloads a malicious installer, without asking permission.

The software installed is a covert build of Teramind, a commercial monitoring tool companies use to record what employees do on work computers. Many anti-malware solutions may not catch this because it would look like a legitimate application. But in the hands of a threat actor it’s gold: It logs keystrokes, takes screenshots at regular intervals, records which websites were visited and which applications were opened, captures clipboard contents and tracks email and file activity.

Zoom has long been a service that threat actors try to use to their advantage, because employees are used to getting invitations to join a meeting from colleagues, managers, and customers.

Fake Zoom meeting scams usually start with phishing emails or text messages, so the first defense CSOs need to deploy is employee security awareness training.

“Taking five seconds to confirm a meeting link really leads to zoom.us [instead of an impostor link] is a simple habit that can prevent a serious problem,” Malwarebytes advises. The fake website that victims are sent to in this campaign is uswebzoomus[.]com/zoom/

Roger Grimes, CISO advisor at awareness training provider KnowBe4, said he’s seen many malicious Zoom calls start with meeting invites in both Gmail and Microsoft Outlook. In fact, earlier this month he got one that was automatically added to his online calendar. Like most phishing lures, the calendar notice had a hard-to-miss subject line: “Final Notice: Payroll Acknowledgement Action Required: Meeting with …”

One of the key indicators of a possible phishing lure is a subject line that demands fast action so, hopefully, the target doesn’t think before clicking. Another tip this was likely a fake: It arrived on a Sunday afternoon.

Employees must be educated to not trust unexpected calendar invites or Zoom meetings, especially when they include unknown names and email addresses, he said.

“The way to avoid 99% of scams is to be super skeptical of any unexpected incoming message asking you to do something you’ve never done before (for example, install new software while attending a meeting),” he said. “If you get a message or an invitation including those two traits (they’re unexpected and asking you to do something you’ve never done before), research it using a trusted source outside the message before performing the requested actions.”

David Shipley, CEO of awareness training provider Beauceron Security, agreed employee training about fake Zoom invites is essential.

“Our research has shown that the two top reasons people click on a phishing link are that it looked legitimate and they were expecting something similar,” he said. “Thanks to AI, phishes look better than ever and can be more precisely targeted.”

The key when teaching people isn’t just offering the traditional advice around checking the sender, subject line, or link, he added; 40% of people don’t even think before they click.

“The key is teaching people to slow down with e-mail (or any communication tool the outside world can send messages to) and to always ask the following questions: ‘Do I know who is sending me this? Am I expecting it from this person? Does it feel off?’”

The second teaching point, he said, is to remind staff to report if, after clicking on a Zoom email invite, it does something new, like installing software.

Warnings about fake Zoom invites are widespread, coming from many sources, from a security vendor to the Pennsylvania Association of Realtors. Last October the association warned that so-called potential buyers are targeting agents with listings on the Multiple Listing Service (MLS), Realtor.com, and Zillow, showing interest in a property. Before submitting an offer, the potential client insists on having a Zoom meeting to discuss the property with the agent. The scammer sends a Zoom link, but when an agent clicks on it, malware is installed on their computer or phone.

Similarly, last summer the University at Buffalo warned students and staff that hackers were sending fake “Zoom invitation” links to UBmail accounts, with the goal of installing malware.

And Zoom itself has blogged on how to avoid being stung by job offer scams.

Malwarebytes didn’t explain how the specific campaign it reports on in the blog is initiated. But if a victim accepts a meeting invite and goes to the fake site, they arrive in what looks like a Zoom waiting room. At the same time, the site quietly sends a message to the attackers letting them know someone has entered.

Three scripted fake participants—“Matthew Karlsson,” “James Whitmore,” and “Sarah Chen”—appear to join the call one by one, each announced by a genuine-sounding Zoom join chime. But their conversation audio loops on repeat in the background. Nothing else happens unless the victim tries to interact. Then a permanent “Network Issue” warning is displayed over the main video tile, seemingly to explain the choppy audio and lagging video. When an “Update Available” prompt appears moments later, Malwarebytes says, it feels like a fix for the problem.

At that point there is one chance to stop the attack: The victim has to click on the download for the installation to proceed. Many employees would, for it feels like the natural thing to do, says Stefan Dasic, Malwarebytes manager of  research and response. That’s why it’s important that employees be trained to never update Zoom from a link in a message. Updates should only come from the Zoom update within the application.

If the victim clicks on the download, a pop-up with no close button takes over, saying: “Update Available — A new version is available for download.” A spinner turns and a counter ticks from five to zero; when the counter hits zero, the browser is instructed to silently download a file. At the same moment, the page switches to what looks like the Microsoft Store, showing “Zoom Workplace” mid-installation, spinner and all. While the visitor watches what appears to be a legitimate install resolving the problem, the real installer with the spyware has already landed in their Downloads folder without asking for permission and is compromising their system. The installer contains code to prevent it from being analyzed by anti-malware solutions.

“The attackers did not write custom malware,” the blog points out. “They deployed a professionally developed commercial product that is designed to run reliably and persist through restarts. That makes it more durable than many traditional malware strains.”

This campaign does not rely on technical sophistication, the blog adds. “No new hacking technique was used. The attacker built a convincing fake Zoom page, set an automatic download to fire before any visitor has a reason to be suspicious, and used a fake Microsoft Store screen to explain it all away. From click to install takes less than thirty seconds. Someone who was expecting a Zoom invite and saw what looked like a Microsoft installation in progress could easily walk away believing nothing unusual had happened.”

Malwarebytes advises infosec leaders who learn that an employee visited the uswebzoomus site to treat their computer as compromised.

[39] CSO Online - VMware fixes command injection flaw in Aria Operations
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 379 kelime]
Two other flaws were patched by the virtualization vendor, impacting Cloud Foundation, Telco Cloud Platform, and Telco Cloud Infrastructure as well.

VMware has released patches for several high- and medium-risk vulnerabilities that impact its Aria Operations, Cloud Foundation, Telco Cloud Platform, and Telco Cloud Infrastructure products.

The most serious of these flaws allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying OS, while another gives authenticated users the ability to elevate to administrator privileges.

The issues — CVE-2026-22719, CVE-2026-22720, and CVE-2026-22721 — were privately reported to Broadcom and there is no evidence of in-the-wild exploitation so far. However, critical Aria Operations vulnerabilities have been exploited in the past and enterprise virtualization infrastructure has been targeted by state-sponsored threat actors.

Broadcom advises customers to upgrade to Aria Operations 8.18.6, as well as versions 5.2.3 or 9.0.2 VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF). VMware Telco Cloud Platform and Telco Cloud Infrastructure are also impacted because they include Aria Operations, the IT management component for private and multicloud environments.

Command injection and privilege escalation

Even though CVE-2026-22719 is an unauthenticated command injection flaw that can lead to remote code execution, the vulnerability is rated high rather than critical severity because it can only be exploited when support-assisted product migration is in progress, making widespread exploitation less likely.

By comparison in 2023 following the disclosure of a command injection flaw in Aria Operations for Networks, security companies detected almost 700,000 attack attempts.

The second vulnerability, CVE-2026-22720, is described as a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue that is also rated high severity, with a score of 8.0 on the CVSS scale. This flaw allows attackers with privileges to create custom benchmarks on a deployment to inject persistent scripting that would perform administrative actions.

The third flaw is a moderate severity issue with a rating of 6.2 that can be exploited if attackers obtain privileges in vCenter that allow them to access Aria Operations. vCenter is the management platform for vSphere virtual environments, and this vulnerability is considered a privilege escalation issue because it could lead to administrative privileges in Aria.

[TAM METİN - 1057 kelime]
When attackers target trust instead of technology, organizations must respond with verification habits and empowered staff.

Business email compromise (BEC) is the digital con dressed to impress. It’s clean, calculated, and ready to fool even the sharpest eyes. These scammers don’t tell on themselves with sloppy hacks. They whisper in familiar voices, posing as your CEO, HR, or a trusted vendor. And, unlike phishing, they’re a precision strike built on inside intel.

Just last year, BEC attacks racked up a staggering $2.7 billion in losses, a jump of 12.5% compared to 2021. That’s not petty cash, that’s financial carnage. And guess what? The scammers don’t need malware. All they need is your trust.

Let’s break down 10 email compromise examples that’ll make you double-check every email in your inbox.

What’s business email compromise?

BEC is when cybercriminals pose as someone you trust—your boss, your lawyer, your vendor—to trick you into handing over money or sensitive info. They study your habits, mimic your contacts, and wait for the perfect moment to make their move.

Want to see how these scams play out and how to stay ahead of them? Check out our full breakdown of business email compromise tactics and trends.

How’s BEC different from phishing?

Here’s a quick summary of how each attack strategy operates:

Types of business email compromise (and their new tricks)

BEC is constantly evolving. Check out the latest business email compromise trends:

AI-style cloning: They’re using AI to sound exactly like your boss.

Fake invoice schemes: Forged invoices look like they’re from trusted vendors, but direct payments to a bogus account.

QR code attacks: Embedded QR codes in emails to send victims to phishing sites or trigger malicious downloads.

Conversation hacking: Attackers take over legitimate email threads to steal sensitive information or manipulate employees into taking certain actions.

This isn’t your grandma’s Nigerian prince scam. It’s Ocean’s Eleven but with Gmail. To give you a taste of how these high-stakes cons play out, here are 10 real-life business email compromise examples.

1. Toyota Supplier: $37 million BEC attack

In 2019, a Toyota supplier fell victim to a $37 million BEC attack. A third-party hacker, impersonating a business partner of one of Toyota’s subsidiaries, sent emails to finance and accounting teams requesting that funds be transferred to an account under their control. This type of attack is commonly referred to as a vendor email compromise (VEC).

2. Ubiquiti: $46.7m vendor fraud

Ubiquiti, a networking company, was hit in 2015 with a massive $46.7 million loss involving fake vendor impersonations. The attack impersonated emails and made fraudulent requests from an external source, tricking the finance department into approving transfers to overseas accounts controlled by third parties.

3. Facebook and Google: $121m BEC scam

Hard to believe, but tech giants like Facebook and Google were duped by a phishing attack that cost them over $121 million between 2013 and 2015. Evaldas Rimasauskas posed as an external vendor, sending emails with convincing invoices to company staffers requesting payment. Once the companies wired the money, he quickly moved the funds to various bank accounts around the world.

4. Fraudsters swipe $2.8 million from Grand Rapids Public Schools in Michigan

Grand Rapids Public Schools in Michigan lost $2.8 million. Scammers accessed the email of the district’s benefits coordinator, using it to intercept communications and redirect the district’s insurance payments into a different account.

5. CFO impersonator swindles Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta out of $3.6 million

In 2018, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta was hit when a fraudster impersonated the CFO. The scammer tricked the hospital’s accounts payable department into updating the bank account details on file, resulting in a $3.6 million transfer to a fraudulent account.

6. Real estate developer scammed for €38 million

A real estate firm was swindled out of €38 million by an international group of fraudsters using social engineering tactics in 2021. The scammers impersonated lawyers, gaining the firm’s trust by pressing for a confidential and urgent wire transfer.

7. Building deception: $793,000 stolen from church’s construction fund

A scammer took advantage of a North Carolina church’s new construction project, stealing $793,000 in 2022. Posing as the contractor, the fraudster subtly altered one letter in the email address to redirect the funds into their own hands.

8. Cybercriminals steal $11.1 million from Medicare and Medicaid

In a targeted BEC attack, cybercriminals impersonated trusted figures to target the government healthcare programs Medicare and Medicaid. By spoofing emails, they successfully diverted $11.1 million into fraudulent bank accounts.

9. Save the Children: $1 million

Save the Children lost $1 million in 2017 when fraudsters got into an employee’s email account and impersonated a staff member. Using fake invoices and email requests, they convinced the charity to transfer the funds.

10. Guillermo Perez: $2.2 million

Between 2018 and 2019, Guillermo Perez orchestrated a BEC scam that defrauded several victims out of $2.2 million. He allegedly impersonated individuals and businesses in routine financial transactions, convincing victims to wire money into accounts he controlled alongside his accomplices.

How to fight back: A savvy defense strategy

Stopping BEC is about street smarts and systems. Here’s what you can do:

Verify requests: Always call or use known contacts to double-check money moves.

Two pairs of eyes: Set approval tiers for transfers, especially over a certain dollar amount.

Train your people: Teach your team to smell a scam before it lands. The Huntress Managed Security Awareness Training can help with that.

Invest in email security: Get tools that flag impersonations and fishy senders.

Don’t trust. Verify. Always.

BEC scams knock, smile, and ask politely to rob you. These attacks work because they prey on trust, timing, and familiarity. Your best defense against them isn’t fear, but strategy. Create habits that slow things down, require verification, and eliminate easy targets. Because when a BEC hits, you lose trust, reputation, and time. And that’s a price no one wants to pay.

We understand what threats like credential theft and unauthorized access mean for your business, and we’re here to help. Huntress has you covered with managed identity threat detection and response (ITDR), protecting identities across your organization 24/7.

[41] CSO Online - What are the types of ransomware attacks?
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 24 Feb 2026 21:52:59 +0000

[TAM METİN - 1043 kelime]
Here is a practical look at common ransomware attacks, how they operate, and how organizations can defend against them.

Ransomware isn’t an isolated, potential cyber threat—it’s like a living organism that can shapeshift with multiple strains, tactics, and targets. The cybercriminals behind ransomware attacks run these operations like a business and are motivated to keep up profits at any cost.  Their tactics range from quickly locking down an entire network to slowly leaking sensitive data over time; different types of ransomware pose different threats in their own unique ways.

In this guide, we’ll discuss some examples of ransomware, explain how they work, and outline how businesses can stay ahead of their malicious ways.

What are the main types of ransomware attacks?

Like a thief walking around a parking lot checking for a conveniently unlocked car, cybercriminals are always looking for vulnerabilities. Over the years, many different types of ransomware attacks have popped up, each with its own execution plan.

Generally speaking, the most common types of ransomware include:

Crypto ransomware: Infamous and devastating, this strain encrypts data and will only decrypt it if you pay the ransom. If you don’t pay, you lose your data forever.

Double extortion ransomware: Particularly nasty cybercriminals will lock your data, steal it, and threaten to leak it if you don’t pay up.

Encryptionless ransomware: Some ransomware actors have decided to go straight to stealing data and extorting victims to pay to avoid its release to the internet.

Locker ransomware: This strain locks victims out of their systems, making them totally inaccessible until the ransom is paid, leaving you helpless.

Scareware: Especially devious, fake software claiming to be your “knight in shining armor” against a phony virus pressures you to pay for a bogus “fix.”

Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS): Like legitimate subscription models, cybercriminals rent ransomware tools from developers to help amateur hackers get their kicks.

What is the most common ransomware attack?

It is well known in the cybersecurity community that crypto ransomware is the most common type that cybercriminals use.

Crypto ransomware is the perfect combination of powerlessness and pressure. Cybercriminals go in, use strong encryption (asserting power over the victim), and can put immense pressure on the victim until the ransom is paid. It’s simple and specifically targets valuable data, immediately impacting the business.

A variant strain of crypto-ransomware is double extortion, which uses the same “hostage situation” of encrypting data. The main difference is that instead of deleting valuable data like crypto, hackers’ favorite scare tactic for getting people to pay the ransom is the threat of leaking sensitive data.

The distinction between these types can sometimes blur, as many modern ransomware attacks use multiple tactics to pressure victims.

What are the different types of ransomware detection?

Detecting ransomware before it can take hold is crucial, and cybersecurity experts use several methods to stay a step ahead of threat actors. These are the ways you can detect ransomware:

Behavior analysis: Behavioral detection looks at how files and applications behave, which can help expose suspicious activity. For example, take mass encryption—behavioral analysis spots this tactic before it spreads.

Signature-based detection: One of the most traditional forms of identifying and fighting ransomware strains, signature-based detection looks for unique code signatures associated with common ransomware.

Heuristic analysis: “The best defense is a good offense.” This proactive approach looks at file structures and code patterns to detect modified, new, or emerging ransomware strains.

Deception technology: Using fake files and bait systems—i.e., “Honeypots”—turns potential threats on themselves by luring ransomware and triggering early alerts before actual data is compromised.

A layered approach that includes some or all of the above is the best way to defend against ransomware. This way, both known and unknown threats can be quickly caught and crushed.

Looking over past incident reports from January 2025 to May 2025, we’re able to paint a picture of the most common ransomware variants that we’ve seen across our customers. Out of the 606 reports that were actually ransomware-related, the most common variants were unknown ransomware variants, making up 58.4% of the number of reports issued this year.

You can’t talk about ransomware without talking about malware, as ransomware is just a glimpse of the larger malware picture. Malware attacks come in various forms, and ransomware is just one of the many threats businesses should be aware of.

Trojan Horses are disguised as legitimate software. They trick users into installing them and then drop malicious payloads once active.

Worms are self-replicating malware that can automatically spread across networks without users interacting with them.

Spyware quietly collects sensitive data such as login credentials, credit card numbers, and browsing activity.

Adware, though often less dangerous, bombards users with unwanted advertisements and can sometimes lead to further infections.

Rootkits are deeply embedded bits of malware that give attackers complete control over compromised systems.

While each threat operates differently, they share a common goal: exploiting vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access and inflict damage. Oftentimes, the data collected will be sold on the dark web by data brokers and can ultimately be leveraged by ransomware gangs to gain access to victims’ networks.

How does Huntress stop ransomware attacks from happening?

Huntress takes a proactive, human-led approach to stopping ransomware attacks before they can cause harm. With 24/7 threat monitoring, a dedicated team of cybersecurity experts continuously watches over your endpoints for any signs of suspicious activity.

Through proactive threat hunting and advanced behavioral analysis, Huntress can spot ransomware tactics before they can be executed. If a ransomware strain is detected, automated containment isolates infected endpoints to prevent further spread. Additionally, the Huntress Security Operations Center (SOC) goes beyond merely flagging threats—it actively helps eliminate them and strengthens defenses to ensure the attack doesn’t happen again.

As ransomware attacks evolve daily, relying on outdated defenses just isn’t enough anymore. Huntress’ comprehensive, human-led strategy ensures that threats are halted before they escalate into a full-blown crisis.

Attackers exploit a handful of preventable endpoint weaknesses—from exposed RDP to phishing, abused RMM tools, and unpatched software—making disciplined configuration, user training, and timely patching critical to keeping threat actors out.

Attackers are constantly on the prowl, scoping out vulnerabilities of network-connected devices in your systems. These devices—laptops, desktops, servers, IoT, and more—are like unlocked doors waiting for threat actors to stroll through. And here’s the kicker: many of these vulnerabilities are shockingly common and easily preventable.

Let’s break down the weaknesses we most frequently track across three million endpoints (not a bad sample size!) and what you can do to patch those holes before a threat actor sneaks in and wreaks havoc.

Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP): The open back door

Remote Desktop Protocol is a prolific protocol used for remote connectivity, but it’s also one of the most common ways threat actors gain access to endpoint devices. In fact, up to 70% of organizations have RDP exposed to the public internet. Think of an exposed RDP connection as leaving a spare key under the doormat—while not quite in plain sight, it’s a pretty obvious place to look if you want to get inside.

Here’s an example of what happens:

Attackers often use brute force attacks on RDP, cycling through password options until they unlock a login session. Once the initial intrusion is established, they usually don’t waste time dropping malware and trying to move laterally across your network.

An example of event logs showing a successful use of brute force.

Don’t expose RDP to the public internet unless you really need to.

Be a stickler with admin rights. Think about who actually needs access to do their job.

Don’t rely on passwords—it’s old school (and way too risky). Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for RDP sessions.

Don’t slack on Windows security configurations. Defaults won’t cut it against attackers who want a piece of your network.

Be vigilant for suspicious activity, like logins from unknown IP addresses.

Phishing attacks: Don’t take the bait

Email phishing is a classic cybercrime strategy, and some things just never go out of style. Every day, phishing emails land in inboxes and a staggering number of victims still fall for social engineering scams. This isn’t a new tactic by any stretch of the imagination, but threat actors continue to rely on it because it works—phishing accounts for 15% of all data breaches. But what’s more alarming about phishing attacks these days is that they’re getting craftier, especially as threat actors turn to generative AI tools to fast-track their social engineering tactics. From expertly mimicked branding to fake invoices with urgent requests, hackers have leveled up their game to trick victims into clicking malicious links or giving up personal details to “customer service” over the phone. Phishing isn’t just email anymore—hackers will use any type of communication mechanism: email, text, phone calls, voicemail, QR codes, or any combination of these approaches.

Here’s an example of what happens:

Let’s take a look at email phishing. When an employee clicks on a malicious link in a phishing email, they might unknowingly hand over sensitive credentials to an attacker or install malware on their system. Or, even worse, they may detonate a ransomware attack. Phishing often uses pressure tactics to prey on victims’ emotions to get a quick response. The attackers walk away with access to your network and sensitive info while leaving you with the mess. It could become an even bigger mess than you’ve bargained for if the attacker gains persistence to endpoints and you don’t immediately find the damage.

Got an email asking for sensitive info? Don’t respond directly to the sender to avoid falling into the attacker’s trap.

An example of a malicious fake thread email phishing attempt.

Get your organization smart on phishing tactics! Regularly scheduled security awareness training (SAT) can make users less likely to jump on sketchy requests. You want their “spidey senses” tingling when weird emails show up!

Use MFA because it can reduce the damage if (when) credentials are compromised.

Remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools: The double-edged sword

RMM tools are double-edged swords. On the one hand, they help IT admins, managed service providers (MSPs), and system admins monitor, manage, and troubleshoot fleets of computers with ease. On the other hand, when left unsecured (as they often are), RMM tools are an easy entry point for attackers to hit your endpoints hard. According to Huntress’ 2025 Cyber Threat Report, 17.3% of all remote access methods originated from RMM abuse. Threat actors like to blend in and hide in plain sight, and legitimate RMM tools are an easy way to do this.

Here’s an example of what happens:

Attackers abuse RMM software and tools to gain unauthorized remote access to compromise devices. Whether they use pre-existing RMMs or install their own, they can potentially control every connected device across your organization, lurking under the auspices of legitimate software. RMM attacks are dangerous because there’s always a risk that attackers will fly under the radar of your detection systems, moving laterally and gaining persistence without even dropping malware.

There are generally two ways attackers abuse RMMs. First, they can hijack or abuse existing software by exploiting outdated, unpatched, or misconfigured tools, or by stealing credentials to log in remotely to RMM tools. Second, they can deploy and install the attacker’s preferred RMM tool via social engineering or portable executables.

Portable executables are notable for their ability to skirt around admin privileges and full software installation, giving attackers local user access. Even if a risk management control is supposed to block or audit the RMM software on the network, it doesn’t matter because portable executables don’t require admin privileges, giving the threat actor a free pass into your network. That’s the stuff of nightmares because threat actors drop into your environment undetected without using malware.

Your RMM tools should make endpoints more secure, not less. Tighten up those settings and keep potential bad actors out.

Example of legitimate RMM tool compromise.

Use role-based permissions. They are king. If you’re not on the guest list, you don’t get access to the RMM software party.

Update and apply patches to RMM software to address vulnerabilities and bug fixes.

Monitor activity logs for unusual activity. Unauthorized installs or funky logins should be a red flag.

Know what types of RMM tools are supposed to be in your network. Audit, track, and monitor so that an unauthorized instance stands out.

For more on keeping RMM tools secure, check out:

Think Your ScreenConnect Server Is Hacked? Here’s What To Look For.

Vulnerability Reproduced: Immediately Patch ScreenConnect 23.9.8

Unpatched software: An open door to your network

Unpatched software is the cybersecurity equivalent of leaving your front door open. Yes, the breeze might be nice, but you probably wouldn’t leave it wide open most of the time. It’s too risky. Your pets or kids can get loose, outdoor critters can make themselves at home (who wants raccoons in their kitchen?), and worse, thieves can just walk in.

If you wouldn’t expose your physical environment to this type of risk, why would you allow it virtually?

Software vendors release patches for different reasons, but often to fix publicly known security vulnerabilities, usually referred to as CVEs. Attackers use this public information to target outdated software and systems. A single instance of an unpatched flaw is an opportunity for an attacker to drop ransomware or malware, or to pull off data breaches. When a new vulnerability drops, you’re up against the clock to get your systems patched before a threat actor takes advantage of you.

If you’re not updating your software regularly, your endpoints are at unnecessary risk. The door is wide open for unwanted guests. It’s that simple.

Example of PowerShell script exploiting CVE-2023-27532 in outdated Veeam software.

Set up automatic updates wherever possible. No excuses.

Keep a regular patch management schedule and stick to it.

Have a battle plan for patching prioritization, since not all vulnerabilities are created equally.

Stay proactive, stay protected

Endpoint vulnerabilities don’t have to be your Achilles’ heel—they’re manageable with the right strategies and tools. Phishing training, endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, RMM audits, patch schedules, and strong authentication measures are just the start.

It’s time to take action and secure your systems before attackers target them. Don’t leave it to chance. Examine your cybersecurity tools, train your team, and implement endpoint protection solutions that fit your setup.

[43] Infoblox Blog - Network Transformation without the Trauma
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 24 Feb 2026 15:55:32 +0000

[TAM METİN - 1232 kelime]
When you hear the phrase “network transformation,” what comes to mind? Massive infrastructure overhauls? Major business disruption? Huge capital investments? You could be forgiven for assuming that modernizing IT operations always comes with a lot of pain—because historically, that’s exactly how transformation projects unfolded.

But it doesn’t have to be that way.

When we launched the Infoblox Universal DDI™ Product Suite in late 2024, the goal was to help businesses fundamentally rethink how they deliver and manage foundational DNS, DHCP and IP address management (IPAM), or DDI network services. Just over a year later—with more than 300 customers onboarded—we’re seeing that transformation take shape. Sometimes it does involve large initiatives. But the most compelling results come from something else entirely: customers achieving real, measurable outcomes without disruptive, rip-and-replace projects.

That’s by design. Universal DDI can absolutely accelerate large-scale modernization efforts. But more often, customers start small. They plug into a single API, target one or two high-impact use cases and start realizing concrete operational benefits almost immediately. These early wins reduce risk, build confidence and create momentum for broader transformation.

Here are six of the most common “quick win” scenarios we’re seeing today.

Quick Win #1: Modernize Microsoft DNS/DHCP Management—without Replacing Infrastructure

For organizations looking to update on-premises networks that rely on legacy Microsoft DNS and DHCP services bundled with Windows Server, Universal DDI provides a fast path to centralized visibility and control. With a lightweight agent providing bidirectional synchronization between Infoblox and Windows Server, Microsoft admins can continue using the same familiar tools. Meanwhile, NetOps teams gain the ability to use role-based access control (RBAC), fine-grained auditing and centralized change management, without touching domain controllers or replacing servers. These customers can still migrate away from those distributed controllers in the future, but now they can do it at their own pace, while minimizing many of the inefficiencies associated with them.

Learn more about Universal DDI for Microsoft Management.

Deploy the Universal DDI for Microsoft Management agent to two to three Windows DNS/DHCP servers.

Validate bidirectional synchronization and enable role-based access.

Centralized management replaces server-by-server changes, reduces configuration drift and creates a clean migration path away from Windows Server—when and if you’re ready.

Quick Win #2: Accelerate Site Turn-Ups, Simplify Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) without Adding Headcount

For new branches, clinics, retail locations or pop-up sites, Universal DDI helps customers turn up DNS and DHCP in minutes. No complex, months-long deployments. (And for those using infrastructure-free NIOS-X as a Service, no local appliances to deploy and maintain.) Just cloud-managed services with consistent policy and the ability to bring new sites online remotely with a few clicks.

Early customers have found these capabilities especially valuable during M&A activity. Universal DDI centralizes management of DNS, DHCP and IP policy so new entities are visible and centrally governed immediately, using software as a service (SaaS) where appropriate and NIOS where it already exists. The results? One customer, Truma, made new site turn-up so simple and automated, the company was able to expand to new sites across Europe with the same small team. “Standardizing with Universal DDI let us scale globally, onboarding 10 entities across seven countries, without local partners or additional headcount,” said Andreas Schmidt, IT system engineer, Truma Gerätetechnik. “That would have been impossible with our old systems.”

Read how Infoblox simplifies and protects infrastructure during mergers, acquisitions and divestitures.

Create a reusable IP and DNS policy block for new sites and M&A scenarios.

Apply it to one new location/acquired entity and measure time to first productive access.

Faster Day-1 integration and Day-2 operations, with less manual effort and more consistent governance.

Quick Win #3: Unify Cloud DNS Control across Hybrid, Multi-Cloud Environments—without Adding Hardware

Universal DDI centralizes DNS provisioning and policy for Amazon Route 53, Azure DNS and Google Cloud DNS through a single management plane and API. Customers can keep working with the providers they prefer while breaking down the silos that keep cloud assets isolated from the rest of the IT environment. Now, NetOps can manage critical network services across all environments and assets the same way, using the same authoritative IP information. And CloudOps teams can move faster with new deployments, with less coordination and overhead.

Learn more about Universal DDI streamlines DNS management in multi-cloud networks.

Onboard one cloud DNS account or subscription.

Standardize a single change workflow and automate a routine task via API.

Consistent, auditable DNS changes across clouds with fewer delays, errors and outages.

Quick Win #4: Prevent IP Conflicts across Clouds with Centralized IP Address Policy

IP overlaps are easy to create and painful to fix. Universal DDI lets you define IP address policies once and enforce them consistently across AWS, Azure, Google Cloud and on-prem environments—preventing costly outages.

Learn more about how Universal DDI makes it easy to enforce consistent IPAM policy across on-premises networks and clouds.

Enable IP policy checks for one cloud environment.

Scan for conflicts or overlaps and remediate.

Fewer failed deployments, less late-stage rework and smoother application rollouts.

Quick Win #5: Simplify Operations by Managing Internal and External DNS Together

Reduce tool sprawl and risk by managing internal DNS alongside third-party external DNS services from providers like Cloudflare, Akamai, AWS, Azure and Google Cloud—all from the same API and interface. No need to change what you already use, you can now just manage everything together with unified DNS zone management.

Watch this demo of how easy it is to manage external DNS records in Cloudflare and Akamai with Universal DDI.

Onboard one supported external DNS provider.

Run a single end-to-end change workflow for a critical domain.

Cleaner change control, fewer handoffs and a consistent audit trail across environments.

Quick Win #6: Replace Spreadsheet Toil with API-Driven DDI Automation

Many teams still rely on spreadsheets and manual processes for DNS and IP changes. Universal DDI establishes a single, authoritative source of IP information across the enterprise and exposes it through one API. Suddenly, it becomes much easier to automate common workflows using Terraform or existing infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools and achieve more robust and comprehensive automation at scale.

One customer, a global financial services firm, has already broken down Microsoft DNS and Route 53 silos that used to make even straightforward changes more complicated and riskier. Now, using Universal DDI and Terraform, they use the same standardized, automated workflows across regions.

Learn more about Infoblox IaC innovations.

Identify one noisy, repetitive task (for example, DNS record cutovers).

Automate it using the Universal DDI API and measure time saved.

Reduced human error, faster releases and safer change windows.

Choose Your First 30-Day Project

Notice some common themes in these scenarios? The best quick wins share three traits. They:

Solve highly visible operational problems such as frequent tickets or recurring incidents

Start small, initially focusing on one cloud account, one site or a handful of servers, to minimize effort and risk

Provide measurable outcomes such as time to change, conflicts prevented and deployment speed to build momentum for ongoing transformation

Bottom line, the ability to deliver fast, measurable, compounding wins is not accidental. It’s what Universal DDI is built to do. Start with a modern management plane based on one API and cloud portal. Centralize what you already run, enforce IP policy and automate the changes you make every day. You’ll start seeing outcomes immediately—reduced risk and outages, faster deployments, less manual effort—even as you lay down a pragmatic, low-friction path to full modernization.
